<LI><A NAME="SPINE"></A><A NAME="2K"></A>
	<A HREF="http://choices.cs.uiuc.edu/2k"
	>2K</A> (formerly known as SPINE) is
	a distributed, reflective, component-based, adaptable operating system
        being built by researchers at the Systems Software Research Group
	from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign
	and the Systems and Communications Group
	from the Universidad Carlos III - Madrid.

<LI><A NAME="Aegis"></A><A NAME="Exokernel"></A>
	<A HREF="http://www.pdos.lcs.mit.edu/exo.html">Aegis</A>
        (developed at MIT's Parallel and Distributed OSes group)
	is an OS based upon the idea of an "ExoKernel"
	(much like the NoKernel idea behind Tunes:
	there is no more runtime kernel in the OS,
	which yields up to 10000% performance gain).
	Also see <A HREF="http://www.pdos.lcs.mit.edu/~engler/"
	>D. Engler's page</A>, and the various
	<A HREF="http://www.pdos.lcs.mit.edu/PDOS-papers.html"

<A NAME="Express"></A>
<LI>
	Olin Shivers'
	<A HREF="http://www.ai.mit.edu/projects/express/">Express</A> project
	at MIT developed ML/OS, an OS in ML,
	by combining SML/NJ with the <A HREF="OSes.html#Flux">Flux OS Kit</A>,
	reusing the web server from the <A HREF="OSes.html#Fox">Fox</A> project.

<A NAME="Flux"></A>
<A NAME="Fluke"></A>
<LI>
	The <A HREF="http://www.cs.utah.edu/projects/flux/">Flux project</A>
	at university of Utah has been developing
	an <A HREF="ftp://flux.cs.utah.edu/flux/oskit/">OS toolkit</A>
	(mirrored in <A HREF="ftp://minnie.cs.adfa.edu.au/pub/oskit/"
		>Australia</A>),
	now release 0.97,
	so anyone can make their own OS from bricks.
	It is also developing its own Fluke microkernel on top.

<LI><A NAME="Hope"></A>
        <A HREF="http://www.cse.ogi.edu/~crispin/hope.html">HOPE</A>
        at the Oregon Institute of Science and Technology, a set of
        primitives on top of a virtual machine, for optimistic programming,
        i.e. guessing the result of operations in order to increase
        parallelism.
</UL>


<A NAME="yoctix"></A>
<LI><A HREF="mailto:g@dd.chalmers.se">Anders Gavare</A>'s
<A HREF="http://www.dd.chalmers.se/~f98anga/projects/yoctix/">Yoctix</A>
is an emerging operating system very much inspired by BSD Unix, but
implemented fully from scratch and following its own path. Anders' goal
is to educate himself and to come up with a full documentation, written as
he progresses, of how to write such a thing. After only 6 months of work,
Yoctix boots /sbin/init. Even cutting corners as he did, this is very
impressive. Definitely worth a look.

<LI>
<A HREF="mailto:gerhards@michael.net">Michael Gerhards</A>'
<A HREF="http://come.to/UniqueOS">UniqueOS</A> plans to make
an OS based on no fixed data structures, using a technique
called tag items, borrowed from AmigaOS. More information
and documentation can be found on the site. A few sources
can be downloaded.

<LI>
<A HREF="mailto:wejo@alb.de">Jascha Wetzel</A>'s
<A HREF="http://free.prohosting.com/~xos/">XOS</A> aims at being an
object-oriented, distributed, preemptively multitasked/threaded,
message-passing based system. While this would sound like pretty
standard marketroid talk, the site contains very interesting,
detailed and clear documentation about what the author has in
mind, an object-oriented microkernel where every part of the
system does one thing and does it well, without any of the other
parts knowing the details; a definite plus for scalability and
future expansion. The author also cares to define the concepts
he uses, so have a look at it even if you don't do C++ in your
sleep. The actual implementation hasn't started yet, but definitely
a spot to watch.

<A NAME="Dead"></A>
<H2>Apparently dead OS projects</H2>
</A>

The following OS projects seem to be dead, as in not having been
upgraded for years. However, they are still worth mentioning, as
learning tools, and also in the hope that maybe someone will want
to pick up the work where it stopped.

<UL>
<LI>

<A HREF="http://home.onestop.net/kinfira/antares/antares.ftml"
>Antares OS</A> for x86 PCs, that seems pretty much dependent
on x86. Intended to become a microkernel type of design;
left dead at function loader and draft filesystem stage.

<A NAME="EOS"></A>
<A HREF="http://www.public.usit.net/lsellers/eos/">EOS</A>
(ask <A HREF="mailto:cleo@wintokens.com">Cleo Saulnier</A>) was an operating
system specially designed to run games under. The project looks
like it has been abandoned. If you're interested in such a project,
probably the best would be to mail Cleo and see if you can profit
from what has already been done.

<LI>
<A HREF="http://www.niksula.cs.hut.fi/~jberlin/los/">LOS</A> was meant
to be another OS for gamers, like <A HREF="OSes.html#EOS">EOS</A>. However, this
one booted and worked, and there were a few games for it (like an
arkanoid clone).

<LI>
<A HREF="http://pages.infinit.net/quadid/sqos/">SQOS</A>
is a completely conventional OS that was being written entirely in assembler
by two teenagers as a programming challenge (much like <A HREF="OSes.html#kos">KOS</A>
or <A HREF="OSes.html#littleos">LittleOS</A>). They seem to have got fed up with
it though.;

tool for the author and anyone else that cared to use it. However it has
been last updated in march of 1998.

<A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com">Microsoft</A> and

Microsoft Windows NT. It can run most DOS and Win 3.x programs seamlessly,
as well as some Win9x software.
<BR>
While not abandoned by IBM, it is not very actively marketed by them anymore.
However, a company has licensed the right to market
an up-to-date OEM version of OS/2:
<a href="http://www.ecomstation.com">eComStation</a>.
Also, OS/2 has long been actively supported
by a legion of developer-users and enthusiasts,
and good development information is available on the

	is the result of some counter-nature cross between Apple and IBM ;-)
it worked on a brand new operating system,
the CommonPoint application system,

and which has been released on top of AIX in summer '95.
To know more about it, you can browse the first two chapters of
the book <A HREF="http://www.taligent.com/itt.html"
>Inside Taligent Technology</A> by
<A HREF="mailto:Sean.Cotter@eworld.com">Sean Cotter</A>.
All in all, it looks like yet another failure due to C++
introducing unmanageable complexity throughout the system.

<H3>Operating system for embedded devices</H3>

As embedded systems (PDAs, cellphones, point-of-sale devices,
VCRs, industrial robot control, or even your toaster)
become more complex hardware-wise with every generation,
and more features are put into them by the day,
applications they run require more and more
to run on actual operating system code
in order to keep the development time reasonable.

<A NAME="Commercial_Unix"></A>
<H3>Commercial Unices and beyond</H3>

Lots of commercial vendors base their system
on the Unix family of design, as standardized in POSIX.
<BR>
The existence of <A HREF="OSes.html#Unix">free Unix systems</A>
like the great <A HREF="OSes.html#Linux">Linux</A>
forces them to find justifications for charging so much
for systems that were so bad;
hence, recently, significant OS research has been done
by commercial companies, even though the benefit
for users and developers is not obvious,
as "protected" research is by definition not beneficial to people.

<A NAME="DOS"></A>
<H3>DOS-class systems and extensions</H3>

Because DOS has been such a phenomenon in OS history,
that it ought to have a place here,

	for lots of non-DOS systems.

 	running on i386 architectures (also runs under *BSD).
	But it is actually a hardware emulator,
 	and requires that you use an actual DOS software
 	(e.g. OpenDOS or FreeDOS) to run on top of the virtualized hardware.
	Newer versions of DOSEMU will be released as a bundle with FreeDOS.

<A NAME="Code"></A>
<LI>Here is some code that you can link into your OS
	and relieve you from the hassles of blindly getting it to boot,
	by providing you boot software and basic I/O:
	<UL>

<LI>
<A HREF="http://www.slug.org.au/etherboot/">Etherboot</A> and its successor
<A HREF="http://www.nilo.org">NILO</A> allow x86 PCs to boot an operating
system across the network; they include code and tools for producing
EPROMS that can be placed on the corresponding network card sockets so
that diskless PCs can download and start an operating system kernel, using
standard protocols (bootp, dhcp, tftp). They can boot systems like Linux
this way, but are easily adaptable to your own.

	<LI>
	The <A HREF="http://www.cs.utah.edu/projects/flux/">Flux project</A>'s
	<A HREF="ftp://flux.cs.utah.edu/flux/oskit/">OS toolkit</A>.
	<BR>
	The Flux OS kit is a complete modular infrastructure
	that provides all the bricks needed to easily build an OS,
	focusing on what interests you, and reusing components for the rest.
	Newbies have reportedly transformed Unix programs into
	standalone OSes in a matter of hours, using it.

	<LI><A HREF="http://www.uruk.org/grub/">GRUB</A>
		the grand unified boot loader for PC and compatibles.
        Originally written by
        <A HREF=""http://www.uruk.org/~erich/">Erich Boleyn</A>, it
        has been taken over by the <A HREF="http://www.gnu.org">GNU</A>
        project, as Erich didn't have any more time for it, but GNU
        depend on it for the HURD. The original (with documentation,
        and also specification of the multiboot standard) could be
        found <A HREF="http://www.uruk.org/grub/">here</A>; the new
        GNU GRUB is <A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/software/grub/">here</A>
        with even more impressive functionality.
	<BR>
		As mentioned, GRUB is used by the <A HREF="OSes.html#HURD">HURD</A>,
	and it can also boot *BSD, Linux, DOS, and more.
	It's got facilities for accessing the filesystem at boot time,
	so you can safely write your loader as just another 32-bit process.

        <A NAME="DolphinBoot"></A>
        <LI><A HREF="http://www.dolphin.openprojects.net/Bootsector">
        Dolphin bootsector</A> is a bootsector primarily designed to
        boot Dolphin, as the name says, but the author is nice enough to
        have written documentation about how to boot your own OS project
        from it; it handles all protected mode and paging setup for you;
        the whole thing fits in 1 KB so it could be useful when you don't
        have much room, like on a floppy.

<A NAME="SOLO"></A>
	<LI><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~shaggy/software.html"
		>SOLO</A>
		the ShagOS boot loader,
		includes useful x86 debugging features.
	<BR>
	SOLO not only includes boot-time filesystem access,
	but extended IO and debugging facilities;
	might be great to hack your kernel.
	Its license is now unrestricted,
	so that you can now freely use it and distribute it with your code.
	SOLO is definitely worth a look.
