<H2><A NAME="ss2.1">2.1 Purpose and Applicability</A>
</H2>

<P>The TS3P is a generic protocol applicable
to arbitrary stream-based communication model,
where information is passed as a substratum sequence of elements.</P>
<P>We'll define the TS3P as a functor,
taking as parameter all the objects that we'll need during this definition,
and yielding a protocol to encode high-level Tunes objects.</P>
<P>In this early version,
we're ready to make lots of assumptions
about the available low-level protocol,
as long as most current hardware architecture provide them.</P>
<P>The protocol could be adapted to work under more generic circumstances,
but this isn't needed right now, so to save our precious time,
we'll postpone such generalization to whenever it's needed.
Surely we do not allow ourselves to discard such generalization.</P>
<P>This protocol is defined in terms of constructing tactics
that can be recursively combined.</P>
<P>The operations involved are typically of the form
"deconstructing the sequence in some context
into an object of some known type and a rest of sequence".
This makes the TS3P some kind of LL(infinity) generic protocol.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss2.2">2.2 Standard External Structure</A>
</H2>

<P>These are to uniquely unambiguously define the context
of objects taken "out of the blue" from uncontrolled low-level channels.</P>


<H3>Header</H3>

<P>A header will uniquely identify the protocol, its flavor, and its version.</P>
<P>The rest of the stream will be defined in a flavor and version-dependent way.</P>


<H3>Meta-Object Identifier</H3>

<P>Once a sequence is identified as carrying TS3P-encoded data,
a TS3P decoder will look for a label or number
identifying the sub-protocol meta-object to be used,
for the global registry.</P>
<P>The meta-object will take control, using sub-subprotocols, etc,
as appropriate.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss2.3">2.3 Basic encoding</A>
</H2>

<P>Let's say a few things on how to encode basic low-level data objects.</P>

<H3>Information Elements</H3>

<P>To simplify, we're ready to assume
that the low-level communication channels
allow all elements to yield the same amount of information.</P>
<P>We require that a standard representation of an element
be defined as an integer between 0 included and NMAX excluded.</P>
<P>For instance, a typical channel will allow to pass 8-bit bytes.
A lesser channel will pass only some of the possible values
for a byte (for instance, stripping the 8th bit,
doing wierd things if given some control characters, etc).</P>
<P>Assuming the constraints are known,
we can if we're not satisfied,
reconsider such a system that has constraints on passed elements
either as passing normalized integer values,
or as passing the full unrestricted values,
through a standard escape sequence mechanism.</P>
<P>To simplify things further,
we're even ready to assume when needed that NMAX be a power of two.</P>


<H3>Integers</H3>

<P>Given a normalized communication channel,
we can encode natural integers with an already known bound
as their decimal little- or big-endian expansion
in basis NMAX.</P>
<P>Conversely, several numbers x1...xn varying each between 0 and Ni excluded
can be encoded as a number between 0 and the products of Ni's excluded.</P>
<P>All this can be done recursively, so that for instance,
on a channel passing bytes, we can encode numbers</P>
<P>Integers of size unknown are encoded as a known guessed size,
with an escape value meaning that the rest of the sequence will
encode the integer with a higher guess size;
multiple escape values can give some information about the integer,
and the rest of the sequence would only encode the rest of the integer.</P>
<P>Another way is to divide the available values into valid and invalid ones,
and consider that the longest uninterrupted sequence of valid ones
define the integer value, once normalized.</P>
<P>Relative integers of between -N included and N excluded
can be encoded in 2N's complement notation.</P>
<P>Example: Some encoding could encode numbers over ASCII channels as
their hexadecimal 4 bit development,
or a 6 bit development (like uuencode),
instead of their normalized 6.56 bit development,
especially when speed at decoding is useful.
Remaining values then can serve as end-of-number markers.</P>


<H3>Low-level Data Structures</H3>

<P>If we're to encode objects from a known finite set,
the standard way to do that is to encode the object
into its integer index into that set using a standard mapping,
then encode that integer into a sequence of elements
in the standard way as above.</P>
<P>Cartesian products and records of known types
can be encoded as the concatenation of the encodings
of the individual elements.</P>
<P>This works for dependent products and records as well as independent ones,
where the type of the tail of the product or record
can be determined from the value of its head.</P>
<P>As a particular case of the former, arbitrary-length structures
like strings can be encoded either as length-prefixed structures.
They might also be encoded as terminated strings,
when not all the available values of information elements are needed.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss2.4">2.4 Encoding High-Level constructs</A>
</H2>

<P>This all needs to be thought up.
At least, we need primitives from lambda-calculus
with first-class environments.</P>

<H3>Recursive Structures</H3>

<P>They can be expressed in terms of non-recursive structures:
with help of standard fix-points and sharing combinators,
we can express any graph with a tree,
that itself can be just flattened in prefix or postfix way,
by using only operators of implicitly or explicitly fixed/given arity.</P>

<H3>Types and Reflective Objects</H3>

<P>They can be expressed in terms of non-recursive structures,
with help of standard reflective operators.</P>

<H3>Attributes</H3>

<P>Attributes that are external to an object's representation
can be made internal with a proper meta-operator on representations.</P>
<P>As an example of the use of attributes,
signatures (cryptographic or not)
that identify the author of the objects,</P>


<H3>Functions and Code</H3>

<P>Code can be viewed as data once a meta-object is defined.
No special technique are needed, only conventions for standard meta-objects.</P>

<H3>Sorts</H3>

<P>For compression purpose, it might be interesting to split
objects into separate substreams
according to their "type" under some typesystem.
Each substream will have an appropriate compressed encoding.
Of course, these means that we have
random access to the stream representation,
which is generally not compatible with real-time/real-space handling,
unless there is a known small bound
to the total size of the substreams to co-decode.</P>
