    <title>Institutions within TUNES Migration Schemes</title>

    <h1>Institutions within TUNES Migration Schemes</h1>
    <!--#include file="header.html" -->
    <p>Some institutions will be needed to have a global Tunes network successfully running. Such institutions would include markets for free or paying services like synchronizing computers during global computations, or sharing of previously unused resources, etc. Other institutions will provide in a money-back safe/secure fashion:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Synchronization of events up to a global scale.</li>
      <li>Identification of parties for a contract.</li>
      <li>Third party authentification of contracts. A particular case could include proof-verification, enabling software providers' customers to have a trusted third-party verify (possibly secret) proofs.</li>
      <li>Pre-/caching-compilation of source code:
	<p>Software providers may thus distribute binaries to customers who trust them; customers send specifications for desired targets, and the server either replies with corresponding binaries or fails with some appropriate handler.</p>
      </li>
      <li>More generally, the system should allow provision of resources together with a variable number and kind of guarantees on the result.</li>
    </ul>
<p>Sharing of unused resources:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Current systems have basically no security, but paranoia, so that most storage (measured in disk space) and computation (measured in cpu cycles) resources are unused or wasted by unneeded redundancy.</li>
      <li>Tunes should promote institutions that will allow people to freely let friends or customers use their unused resources in a secure way.</li>
      <p>People making their resources thus available basically won't have to care about it: they will have full priority for using their own resources, so that only <em>extra</em> resources are made available.</p>
      <p>They shouldn't have to care about security. The use of a scoped type-safe language would ensure that they fully control whatever resources are or are not available to outsiders, without <em>any</em> possible security holes (unlike with ridiculous unsecure unscoped untyped languages like C).</p>
    <li>For additional security without precluding optimized code, proofs of correctness with respect to resource usage, termination, protocol compliance, can be required from the outsider. When proofs are not available, money-backed warranties can be agreed upon, or the client can agree to limit their computations to something less expressive but still computationally useful.</li>
    <p>Hence, everyone wins with such institutions: everyone has access to more resources for a reduced price.</p>
    <li>This will not restrict the hardware market or demand. People will continue to buy the resources, in as much as they can afford them. Only they will make more out of these hard-earned resources; a computer sitting idle doesn't help anyone, let alone the hardware vendor. (To make a metaphor, having more fuel-efficient cars doesn't reduce the world-wide fuel consumption in any way; but it makes everyone happier).</li>
    <li>Hypothetically, this would promote honesty in sales, since minor fraud would be calculable instead of vague.</li>
  </ul>

    <h2>Paying institutions:</h2>
    <ul>
<li>Note that these institutions need not be an imposed choice;
everyone should be free to change to other institutions.
<li>If there is a need for absolute meta-institutions
(like the root DNS), these should be <em>free</em> to all,
and supported from money-making people and institutions
(e.g. in proportional ratio with the money made by them).
<li>No people or institution should otherwise be ever able to constrain
an aware or unaware user to pay for a service
without a fair competition be made possible
through essentially free meta-services.
<li>It is fair to charge the unaware people in a reasonable fashion
for authoring works in as much as the money fully goes
to the author, and the author has not been fully paid back yet
for the work. Otherwise, only voluntary payment can happen.
<li>However, if everything goes well,
there would be main institutions doing their work correctly,
so that most people wouldn't bother to setup other institutions
or subscribe to them,
but to explore new experimental ways to do things.
<li>Freedom to change would serve as a means of control
of the users toward the institutions:
should they fail to do their work correctly or honestly,
people would migrate to other institutions.
<li>Because most users can't just seek all the information
to rightly choose between institutions,
and to avoid the reign of the institutions with
the best (worst) money-backed propaganda,
there must be <em>free</em> meta-institutions
that will help the aware people decide,
and the default Tunes schedulers would
have the unaware people statistically follow
the choice of aware people.
