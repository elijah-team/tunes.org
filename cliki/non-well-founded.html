>A <a class="internal" href="term.html" >term</a> for systems that are not <a class="internal" href="well-founded.html" >well-founded</a>, meaning that they are not based strictly on a few independent principles.
<p>This means that they have looser logical requirements: that they are merely self-consistent. These systems are very important in computer science despite appearances, since many types are non-wellfounded in nature, such as stream types or other iterative (non-recursive) types. Also, whole-system analyses usually rely on this perspective implicitly, since <a class="internal" href="bootstrap.html" >bootstrap</a>ping is otherwise not easily expressible.
<p>The difference can be summarized as "allowing anything that is not self-contradictory or explicitly disallowed" versus "allowing only the enumerated things and nothing else".
