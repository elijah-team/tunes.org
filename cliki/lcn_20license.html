>A <a class="internal" href="license.html" >license</a> which I am hereby declaring (taking up the suggestion from <a href="http://zooko.com/license_quick_ref.html">zooko</a>) as the Liberal with Copyright Notice (LCN) license, because everyone calls it by the unwieldy name of "The BSD/MIT/X license".
<p>Liberal refers to the fact that the license basically allows you to do anything you want, however in this license you need to also include a Copyright Notice (listing the name of the person/organization who owns the copyright and is granting the license) in some form with every copy of the work distributed.
<p>This license, or the almost-identical <a class="internal" href="lcna_20license.html" >LCNA License</a>, is used by all recent versions of BSD and X11, and is also known as the MIT license (for the organization that created the original X11).  I suggest using the term "LCN Licenses" to refer to the pair of licenses together, and the singular terms to indicate specifically whether the advertising clause is present.
