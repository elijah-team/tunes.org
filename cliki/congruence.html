>A <a class="internal" href="term.html" >term</a> that denotes a class of relationships between <a class="internal" href="algebra_20and_20coalgebra.html" >algebras</a> and which is dual to <a class="internal" href="bisimulation.html" >bisimulation</a>.

<p>Let us consider as an example the algebra of natural numbers with zero and sum as operations. It is obvious that, if <code>x = y</code>, then:
<p><code>a + x = a + y.</code>
<p>In other words, let us consider a <a class="internal" href="context.html" >context</a> <code>a + []</code>: we can fill the hole <code>[]</code> with two equal quantities, and obtain two equal quantities. For instance, being <code>3 = 2 + 1</code> we have that:
<p><code>a + (3) = a + (2 + 1)</code> for every <code>a</code>.
<p>This property of the equality relation is said "replacing equals with equals", or "substitutivity", or "compatibility with the operations", or - less commonly - "congruence". 
<p>In <a class="internal" href="category_20theory.html" >category-theoretic</a> terms, given two algebras <code>A1</code> and <code>A2</code>, a congruence is an algebra <code>A3</code> with a span of homomorphisms from <code>A3</code> to both <code>A1</code> and <code>A2</code>. A homomorphism from an algebra to another one is a function ensuring substitutivity, and thus it can be also said to be a "congruence map": a pair of homomorphisms is, in some sense, a congruence <em>relationship</em>. 
<p>The word "congruence", however, is more commonly used to indicate a substitutive <em>equivalence</em>. We recall that R is an equivalence relation on a set if it is reflexive (<code>a R a</code>), symmetric (if <code>a R b</code>, then <code>b R a</code>), and transitive (if <code>a R b</code> and <code>b R c</code>, then <code>a R c</code>). These are also the core properties of the equality relation <code>=</code>, and we can say that, in a sense, an equivalence relation on a set is a "new kind of equality" over the elements of the set, having a coarser grain than <code>=</code> (i.e., equating more elements than <code>=</code>, which plainly equates an element only with itself).  But an algebra is something more than a plain set, and it turns out that congruences have all the properties we want for defining "new kind of equalities" for algebras: All the properties of equivalence plus substitutivity. <hr><p><b>This page is linked from: </b> <a class="internal" href="bisimulation.html" >Bisimulation</a> &nbsp; <a class="internal" href="diagram.html" >Diagram</a> &nbsp; <a class="internal" href="fusion_20calculus.html" >Fusion Calculus</a> &nbsp; </DIV></BODY></HTML>
