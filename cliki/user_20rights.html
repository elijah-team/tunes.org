>Traditional systems enforce a "<a class="internal" href="security.html" >security</a>" <a class="internal" href="paradigm.html" >paradigm</a> of a finite number of <a class="internal" href="user.html" >user</a>s, each controlling his own files, and having no <em>right</em> (a semi-legal <a class="internal" href="term.html" >term</a>) on those from others. Though it is certainly more secure than systems with no <a class="internal" href="security.html" >security</a> at all (e.g. MS-<a class="internal" href="dos.html" >DOS</a>), such finite <a class="internal" href="security.html" >security</a> systems are just as insecure as soon as arises the need to share any data: whenever programs want to share data, one must blindly trust the others, because the finite <a class="internal" href="security.html" >security</a> semantics cannot map the infinite semantics of actual problems.
<p>To circumvent this difficulty, many propose that no sharing be done; but then it is sometimes (it especially was in the time when no free <a class="internal" href="unix.html" >Unix</a> was available to the masses, and perhaps still is when few <a class="internal" href="user.html" >user</a>s are concerned) better and cheaper to get a smaller machine for each human <a class="internal" href="user.html" >user</a> than to get a big <a class="internal" href="centralized.html" >centralized</a> one bogusly shared between them. Others (see <a class="internal" href="vsta.html" >VSTa</a>) have invented infinite protection systems, where <a class="internal" href="user.html" >user</a>s can have sub-<a class="internal" href="user.html" >user</a>s, which can in turn have sub-<a class="internal" href="user.html" >user</a>s, and so on, recursively.
<p>While nobody can deny that such systems do restrict possible demises of the system, the kind of order enforced by such systems is very much that of a dictatorship, where power was left to a Leviathan to guarantee a civil peace, actually the peace of the dead.
<p>None of these protection schemes tackle the essential problem of <a class="internal" href="security.html" >security</a>; they just add tremendous overhead to programming and program execution, without really solving anything, just postponing insecurity.
<p>TUNES despises such non-solutions to problems.
<p>Traditional systems also use the "<a class="internal" href="user.html" >user</a>" concept as a way to have multiple (but statically many) differently customized versions of the system. 
In TUNES, there is no such concept of static "<a class="internal" href="user.html" >user</a>" erected as a fundamental axiom of the system. Instead, actual human <a class="internal" href="user.html" >user</a>s are free to define as many contexts as they like, to define variously specialized subcontexts indefinitely and dynamically. To the machine, no particular axiom is needed, the human <a class="internal" href="user.html" >user</a> being just a common attribute to some contexts. As for human-<a class="internal" href="user.html" >user</a>-wise <a class="internal" href="security.html" >security</a>, the system allows these contexts to arbitrarily define lists of signatures or <a class="internal" href="capability.html" >capabilities</a> as needed, and (dynamic)ally manage and share their resources at will. Again, <a class="internal" href="dynamism.html" >dynamism</a> and <a class="internal" href="higher-order.html" >higher-order</a> expressiveness, which allow adaptation, win over finite <a class="internal" href="static.html" >static</a> allocation.<hr><p><b>This page is linked from: </b> <a class="internal" href="capability.html" >Capability</a> &nbsp; <a class="internal" href="its.html" >ITS</a> &nbsp; </DIV></BODY></HTML>
