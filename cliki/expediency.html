>This <a class="internal" href="political_20term.html" >political term</a> describes situations benefiting one's (or a few ones') short term and restricted interests.
<p>In a more restricted sense (as used in the <a class="internal" href="tunes_20project.html" >TUNES project</a> acronym), expedient implies that the expedient thing may be harmful or disastrous for the global long term welfare. We thus oppose this restricted expediency to real <a class="internal" href="utility.html" >Utility</a>.
<p>Beware that this does not mean anyhow that all expedient things in the general sense are expedient in the restricted sense. Actually, most of the time, we have only a vague idea of what is really useful or harmful, so <em>in the limits of this knowledge</em>, expediency is the best approximation we have; if we do not have clear ideas about expediency either, we follow <a class="internal" href="tradition.html" >tradition</a>s and habits.
<p>For example, mass murdering and concentration camps are expedient to dictatorial governments; racketeering, selling drugs or weapons are expedient to the mob; industrial monopoly is expedient to the owners of these monopolies and partners in a trust (a.k.a. the white-collar mob); wasting the Earth's natural resources may be expedient to those who exploit these; wasting human work is expedient to those who sell broken el cheapo products in a cheated market with unfair competition; but all these are extremely harmful to the world.<hr><p><b>This page is linked from: </b> <a class="internal" href="open.html" >Open</a> &nbsp; <a class="internal" href="open_20development.html" >Open Development</a> &nbsp; <a class="internal" href="statism.html" >Statism</a> &nbsp; <a class="internal" href="utility.html" >Utility</a> &nbsp; </DIV></BODY></HTML>
