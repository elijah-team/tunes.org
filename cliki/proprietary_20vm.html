>This is the <a class="internal" href="topic.html" >topic</a> for machines you shouldn't use, least you'll become the hostage of the vendors who lock you and whoever else you will communicate with you into their technology.
<p>However attractive a proprietary technology may appear, it shouldn't be used as a means of communication.
<p>Happily, no one owns the english language.
<p>Of course, it is good to know what proprietary VMs exist or have existed, to be aware of their advantages and shortcomings, which is why they are listed here.
