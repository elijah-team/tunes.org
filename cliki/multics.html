  >Multics</a> is the "great" <a class="internal" href="os.html" >OS</a> (written in <a class="internal" href="pl_2fi.html" >PL/I</a>) whose design began in the late 60's, co-written by MIT, AT&T Bell Labs and GE, that was meant to become the be-all- end-all of <a class="internal" href="os.html" >OS</a> technology by having just every (un)imaginable feature, and that was supplanted by <a class="internal" href="unix.html" >Unix</a>, despite the fact that Multics was much better(?) designed, because <a class="internal" href="unix.html" >Unix</a>' simple and stubborn design was much more adapted to the very resource-poor architectures of the time. Ken Thompson began UNIX after AT&T Bell Labs pulled out of the Multics project in 1969. The official story is that it was a research system, but we all know that it was really so he could port SpaceWar to the PDP-7. Eventually, Multics was aquired by Honeywell, and supported by them. The last known Multics mainframe was taken offline in October, 2000.<hr><p><b>This page is linked from: </b> <a class="internal" href="pl_2fi.html" >PL/I</a> &nbsp; </DIV></BODY></HTML>
