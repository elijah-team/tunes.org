>Considering a system or universe, the <a class="internal" href="political_20term.html" >political term</a> for anyone that has power to defy the laws of the universe is a God.
<p>Then of course a God does not exist inside the considered universe, but in some outer greater universe, even though he might constantly show his presence through perpetual miracles (see input/output). He may also do punctual miracles, but these are completely beyond understanding from inside the system (as a corollary, anything that's not completely beyond understanding is not a miracle; and subsystems pretending to perceive and/or influence miracles are liars).
<p>Particularly, the human user who can shutdown a computer is a God to the computer programs running on the computer. Thus, in TUNES, we use this appropriate term where other people talk about "super-user".
<p>See also <a class="internal" href="root.html" >root</a> and <a class="internal" href="holy.html" >Holy</a>.
