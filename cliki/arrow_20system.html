Describe the <a class="internal" href="arrow_20system.html" >Arrow system</a> here.

<p>The <a href="../~water/arrow/index.html">project's page</a> provides more information.

<p>The <a href="http://introspector.sourceforge.net/2003/08/ArrowPhilosophy.txt">text 
conversion</a> from mdupont  is much easier to read.

<p>Abstract
This proposal introduces a unified system for computations based on
a cybernetic theory introduced here as model-level reflection. It provides
a specification of what the Arrow system is and what it does for software
systems. It outlines the theoretical basis for the system in terms of analysis
of modern programming systems and their reflective capabilities. The
system transcends the limitations of state-of-the-art reflection systems
due to the current restricted notion of meta-systems. The system can
represent any intuitive concept, and can manage the interactions among
arbitrary domains of knowledge. Because of these properties, the user
may delegate arbitrary aspects of its own operation and management to
itself, with reliable and reusable results. The nature of the system is ideal
for computations in a unified field of knowledge, and as such provides an
ideal basis for the migration of knowledge to new contexts and uses.
