>Hyper-G is a hypertext system, structured using documents, clusters, collections, and links instead of the simple node-link model. A collection is a group of related clusters, and corresponds approximately to a Unix directory. (Collections are hierarchically structured.) Clusters contain related documents that are part of a work (<i>e.g.</i>, the text of an article and graphics included in it). A cluster may be part of more than one collection. All Hyper-G objects have searchable attributes. Because links are stored outside of documents, it is possible to have links to and from specific parts of multimedia files, although it requires one to use specific software for viewing the files.. Hyper-G has some features for collaborative work and a simple security system. Although there were a few clients for it, the WWW gateway is now the most commonly-used interface.
