>A <a class="internal" href="political_20term.html" >political term</a> for a drastic cultural change in a system, in which a long despised, long ignored, or long too expensive point of view, habit, phenomenon, or technique becomes obvious and benefits the whole system: the Copernician Revolution, the Industrial Revolution, the Computer Revolution.
<p>A revolution is also a fundamental change of political regime, accompanied by a civil war or uprising in which the whole people is involved in massacres, author or victim of it. Such a war (which is about the worst thing that can happen to a country), is won by the most violent, so revolution generally leads to ruin and <a class="internal" href="centralization.html" >centralization</a> under the rule of the winner; thus only a truly dreadful regime that already provides such ruin and centralization could perhaps justify one.
<p>A revolution is lastly an activity of some people toward this previous kind of revolution, or more generally any blind, violent, movement to reject traditions. Often, because they have some silly notion about something that would be fit for a revolution in the second meaning, some people, who don't see such revolution happening (and indeed, their notion being silly, it won't happen), often guided by rationalists (in the second, degenerate meaning), become proponent of a revolution in this third meaning to impose it (which they cannot, because in no way does their silly notion correspond to anything useful to the world; often it being utterly harmful).<hr><p><b>This page is linked from: </b> <a class="internal" href="revolutionary.html" >Revolutionary</a> &nbsp; </DIV></BODY></HTML>
