<p><A HREF="http://home.pipeline.com/~hbaker1/sigplannotices/gigo-1997-04.html">I Have a Feeling We're Not In Emerald City Anymore</A
> by <a class="internal" href="henry_20baker.html" >Henry G. Baker</a> or <em><strong>The True Story of <a class="internal" href="ada.html" >Ada</a></strong></em>, his conjecture on why <a class="internal" href="ada.html" >Ada</a> was conceived to be inherently dysfunctional. A joke? Even in this case is so realistic...

<p><strong>Excerpts</strong>:
<blockquote>
[..] By piecing together information from unclassified documents, we are now able--for the first time--to bring you the real story of the <a class="internal" href="ada.html" >Ada</a> Project, whose secrecy, scope and cost rival those of the Manhattan Project. [..]

<p>[..] the US was facing a `Software Gap' with the Soviets. According to [Davis78], the Soviets had "one of the most potent mathematical communities in the world":
<blockquote>To an unusual extent, software productivity is a research and development activity, and thus it benefits from a relative Soviet strength. ... <i>Thus software would appear to have some relative advantages over hardware, even within the scope of Soviet R&amp;D.</i>  ...One of the reasons mathematics has done so well in the Soviet Union is that it is relatively insensitive to the constraints [of high quality materials]...  <i>Software may have a similar advantage as long as it can operate within local hardware limitations.</i> [Davis78; emphasis supplied]</blockquote>

<p>Although Soviet computer hardware was inferior, particularly in memory technology (typical Soviet computers had only a few hundred Kbytes of core and a few tens of Mbytes of disk), Soviet software ingenuity might make their hardware disadvantage moot:
<blockquote>The availability of ES hardware has resulted in something of a ... software explosion...  [Davis78]</blockquote>

<p>Even more troubling were reports of incredible software productivity from US projects using languages like <a class="internal" href="lisp.html" >Lisp</a>, <a class="internal" href="apl.html" >APL</a>, <a class="internal" href="prolog.html" >Prolog</a>, <a class="internal" href="smalltalk.html" >Smalltalk</a> and <a class="internal" href="forth.html" >Forth</a>.  Entire robotic planning systems with natural language and graphics interfaces were programmed by just one or two people in <a class="internal" href="lisp.html" >Lisp</a>. Reams of <a class="internal" href="pl_2fi.html" >PL/I</a> code were replaced by a single line of <a class="internal" href="apl.html" >APL</a>.  <a class="internal" href="prolog.html" >Prolog</a> obsoleted a generation of <a class="internal" href="cobol.html" >Cobol</a> programmers.  <a class="internal" href="smalltalk.html" >Smalltalk</a> and <a class="internal" href="logo.html" >Logo</a> were taught to children, and raised the spectre of a 12-year-old outproducing a dozen beltway bandits.  <strong>Perhaps most troubling of all was <a class="internal" href="forth.html" >Forth</a>, with its ability to very quickly program substantial real-time systems that took insignificant amounts of memory</strong>.

<p>This software "productivity explosion" threatened the very axiom of American military might--that more is better, and a whole lot more is a whole lot better.  Software productivity was expanding faster than software demand, and the trends predicted that by 1997 entire avionics systems would be programmed by a single hacker in sandals, love beads and a pony tail.  It looked like a handful of Soviet super-programmers using these powerful new languages might wipe out any advantage from American hardware prowess.

<p>The American military could not afford to ignore this Soviet software threat.  Although the massive post-Sputnik spending to upgrade American education had produced some early success, SAT scores soon peaked and began a sickening decline.  Joe Geek might not be able to compete mano-a-mano with Ivan Geek.

<p>[..]

<p>Even knowledge of the Ada Project's name required the highest clearances and a need-to-know. <strong>The code name itself was an inside joke: Ada Augusta, Countess of Lovelace, was a famous armchair programmer/system architect who never in her entire life had gotten a single program to compile, link, or run</strong>. {An analogous joke would be giving an Air Force plane the name "Kiwi," after a flightless bird.} Ada's code name was finally declassified--extensive research had shown that no one ever got the inside joke. {`Project Ada' was not the first name suggested; `Project Potemkin' was rejected when it was realized that Soviets might recognize this old Russian ruse.}

<p>[..]

<p>We now know that the <a class="internal" href="ada.html" >Ada</a> Project was very successful. Ivan accepted the <a class="internal" href="ada.html" >Ada</a> wizards' humbuggering at face value. At the time of the Fall of <a class="internal" href="communism.html" >Communism</a>, a number of Soviet <a class="internal" href="ada.html" >Ada</a> projects were under way, and afterwards, at least one Soviet <a class="internal" href="ada.html" >Ada</a> compiler was offered for commercial sale over the Internet.

<p>Now that the Wicked Witch of the East is dead, the wizards have finally allowed <a class="internal" href="ada.html" >Ada</a> to evolve into Ada9X, which fixed some of <a class="internal" href="ada.html" >Ada</a>'s more egregious dysfunctions. However, even today the brilliance of <a class="internal" href="ada.html" >Ada</a>'s original conception still shines brightly through.

<p>That the <a class="internal" href="ada.html" >Ada</a> Project was able to keep its secret for 20 years is a tribute to the dedication and resourcefulness of the wizards of <a class="internal" href="ada.html" >Ada</a>. It wasn't easy being Green--those associated with the <a class="internal" href="ada.html" >Ada</a> Project withstood great criticism and still managed to keep a straight face. The <a class="internal" href="ada.html" >Ada</a> Project cost billions and billions in direct and indirect costs, but who can argue with the result? All of us owe a great debt of gratitude to those in the <a class="internal" href="ada.html" >Ada</a> Project who helped keep America free. We agree with Churchill: "Never in the field of human conflict was so much owed by so many to so few."
