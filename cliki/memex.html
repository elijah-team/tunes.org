>A set of devices and concepts associated with the essay, <a class="internal" href="as_20we_20may_20think.html" >As We May Think</a>, from early computing history, which constitute some original visions about <a class="internal" href="user_20interface.html" >user interface</a>s:

<p><dl>
<dt>The Personal Memex</dt>
<dd>A device capable of and designed to record anything and everything that an individual would want to have available for themselves or others, including voice recordings, moving pictures, and personal structured information.</dd>
<dt>The World-Wide Memex</dt>
<dd>A common, international system for storage and retrieval of public records, and for transferring and arranging the personal recordings of individual people as needed. This would be a mechanism for science, history, and entertainment as well.</dd>
</dl>

<p>These are slightly distorted versions of the original concepts, in light of the rather obvious turn of history which has brought "personal digital assistant" computers and the Internet to relatively-common cultural use.
