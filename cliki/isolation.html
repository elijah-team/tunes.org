>A <a class="internal" href="term.html" >term</a> for when a computer object is not <a class="internal" href="security.html" >secure</a>, it must be isolated from possible sources of failure.
<p>In traditional <a class="internal" href="operating_20system.html" >Operating System</a>s, <a class="internal" href="process.html" >process</a>es are so insecure that the system has to completely, systematically, and paranoidly isolate processes one from the other. This isolation is like having people put in quarantine to prevent possible diseases to propagate. But it also prevents people from interacting one with the other (i.e. to have any social life), and finally people have to cheat it to live at all, and it then loses its few advantages after having wasted a living.</DIV></BODY></HTML>
