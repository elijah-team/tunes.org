>Tril is <a class="internal" href="david_20e._20manifold.html" >David E. Manifold</a>'s <a class="internal" href="alias.html" >alias</a>
<p>I prefer to go by Tril online... it is short for Tril 0. Byte and it doesn't mean anything in particular.  It was my BBS name back in the day.
<p>I do not approve of the TUNES project planning to reserve the right to offer non-free support.  (<A HREF="../tunes.html">http://tunes.org/tunes.html</A
>, just over half-way down the page, under "old blurb")
<p>I completely agree with the <A HREF="../HLL/principles.html">Principles</A
> (formerly Requirements), but am not so sure if I support the HLL <A HREF="../HLL/definition.html">Definition</A
> and <A HREF="../HLL/architecture.html">Architecture</A
>.  I have a different system in mind, which I am implementing (with the help of <a class="internal" href="henzo.html" >HenZo</a>) in <a class="internal" href="max.html" >Max</a>.    All my code will be released to the <a class="internal" href="public_20domain.html" >Public Domain</a>, thus it could be used in anyone else's project if they want, but I do not care if anyone else likes my project and I will continue working on it whether it gets supported by the TUNES project or not.
<p><h3>Less talk, more code</h3>
<p>I have come to believe that writing about TUNES is just spinning thin
air.  I prefer not to say anything any more until there is working code.
This is why I am not active in the specifications discussion or other
discussion threads on TUNES.  I believe this is also why none of my
writings ever became more complete: Because there is no practical code, 
or experience with code, to make the writing have any substance, I  
always simply trailed off without any clue of how my ideas went
together.
<p>So, anyone can post my old writings to CLiki if they want, but keep in
mind that the words have no substance and that I don't intend to edit
them until there's code.
<p>
<h3>What I'm up to</h3>
<p>These are the projects I'm working on
that allow me to fund my own TUNES (<a class="internal" href="max.html" >Max</a>) development and <a class="internal" href="bespin.html" >Bespin</a>.
<p><ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.nas.com/">nas.com</a> - I work part time for this Internet Service Provider doing unix administration and miscellaneous work needing done.  I'm currently working on <a href="http://www.zope.org/">Zope</a> stuff.  I recently helped launch the new nas.com home page, running Zope.
  <li><a href="http://intuitive-access.com/">intuitive-access.com</a> - 
I created this company as a vehicle for some programming ideas which are not
directly TUNES-related.  nas.com only hired me part-time, and I needed
another job but wanted to employ myself.
  <li>Unnamed project - I'm working on a business plan for another business that some friends and I are interested in starting, if feasible.
  <li>More projects - I'm always thinking of new projects, which motivate me
to work hard on the current ones so that I can get to the new ones.
</ul>
