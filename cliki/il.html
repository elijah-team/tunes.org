>An abbreviation for Intermediate Language, which is the compiled representation of an application targeted to a specific machine.

<p>The <a class="internal" href="microsoft.html" >Microsoft</a> <a class="internal" href="_.net.html" >.NET</a> <a class="internal" href="clr.html" >CLR</a> has co-opted this term to signify its standard intermediate language (which has a syntax). Microsoft's IL is commonly compared to <a class="internal" href="java.html" >Java</a> <a class="internal" href="vm.html" >VM</a> <a class="internal" href="bytecode.html" >bytecode</a>, but there are significant differences, mainly in that it is designed to be compiled by a <a class="internal" href="jit.html" >JIT</a> into a machine-executable format, whereas bytecode is intended to be executed directly by a <a class="internal" href="virtual_20machine.html" >Virtual Machine</a>. It should be noted that Java bytecode is <I>usually</I> compiled by a JIT anyway for performance reasons, and it would be <I>possible</I> to run IL as an interpreted language, but it is difficult to imagine why anyone would want to do this.<hr><p><b>This page is linked from: </b> <a class="internal" href="_.net.html" >.NET</a> &nbsp; <a class="internal" href="clr.html" >CLR</a> &nbsp; </DIV></BODY></HTML>
