>The <a class="internal" href="term.html" >term</a> for a <a class="internal" href="meta-object.html" >meta-object</a> representing some "state of affairs": requirements on the relationships between some <a class="internal" href="collection-oriented.html" >collection</a> of <a class="internal" href="object.html" >object</a>s. Configurations are basically the subject matter of a specification: a specification's expression can specify a number of objects to be involved and a certain amount of <a class="internal" href="higher-order.html" >higher-order</a> information about them and the operations upon them.
<p>Traditional systems can be described as consisting of certain objects present in certain slots in a global namespace object or structure, and operations defined on those in certain ways in order to say that "feature X is implemented".
<p>The term arises from common software terminology since it accurately described a certain state of the world, and works at different levels: people use it for options and their values in files as well as directory structures and permissions at the large scale. For TUNES, it's a bit more general, because attributes are <em>not</em> just slots. In fact, they can be anything but slots; they just have to present the same style of interface as an <A HREF="../HLL/general.html#attribute">attribute</A
>. So really, a configuration lifted to this level of abstraction can describe functional tests, like assertions.
<p>Non-obvious applications of the concept include <a class="internal" href="syntax.html" >syntax</a> term trees, which are a kind of information structure that naturally is coupled with higher-order information, but are not a type of collection in the ordinary sense. Another application is the use in describing the relationships between intermediate and end-results in a computation; in this way, multiple-values results can be described in a general way (<em>Note:</em> the abstractness of the attribute concept means that evaluation order, future-ness of values, and such are invisible from the perspective of the configuration).<hr><p><b>This page is linked from: </b> <a class="internal" href="hermes.html" >Hermes</a> &nbsp; </DIV></BODY></HTML>
