>An <a class="internal" href="acronym.html" >acronym</a> for a <a class="internal" href="user_20interface.html" >user interface</a> strategy called "Do What I Mean", where common programming errors are corrected in a live sense. The original system to implement this extensively was Xerox's InterLisp system in the 1970's, which was dynamically-scoped, and so had some programmers often confused about what was or wasn't possible in the context.
<p>It generally turned out to be a benefit and a curse: often errors were mis-diagnosed and the wrong corrections were made. It may be possible to rectify this in a modern environment by presenting handlers for these detections which offer options of correction, including just letting the programmer handle it their own way. <a class="internal" href="smalltalk.html" >Smalltalk</a> environments do this, and most likely Java's Eclipse IDE and Visual Studio in the Windows world have something in this direction.</DIV></BODY></HTML>
