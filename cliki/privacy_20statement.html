In normal operation, the <a class="internal" href="tunes_20project.html" >Tunes project</a>'s <a class="internal" href="cliki.html" >CLiki</a> and the webserver it runs on will collect information about the people browsing and contributing to it.

<p>This information includes:
<ul>
<li>Server logs collected by apache (see <A HREF="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/logs.html#combined">Combined Log Format</A
> on the Apache site).
<li>Text that you provide when editing or adding pages to this web site.  This is - obviously - not private. Please note that no authentication of users is done yet, so there is no sure way to identify who added what to which page.
</ul>
