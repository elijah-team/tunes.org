>The contrasting <a class="internal" href="term.html" >term</a> to <a class="internal" href="centralized.html" >centralized</a>: not obeying to a one guide, chief, führer, duce, central <a class="internal" href="committee.html" >committee</a>, or any other kind of grand beloved all-mighty all-knowing (individual or collective) leader. Not even having such an organization in any part of the system.
<p>As for the runtime software executive in an <a class="internal" href="operating_20system.html" >Operating System</a>, <em>decentralized</em> means that there is no portion of code that would centralize execution, communication, scheduling, and more generally (meta)service dispatch, as current primitive centralized systems do.
<p>In that latter meaning, Tunes will be decentralized: At runtime, this means no "system call" mechanism, but function calls being directly linked/inlined where needed. As for protection, scoping, typed languages, proof systems, and user wrappers provide much quicker, finer, more expressive protection than a kernel will ever allow. A centralized (kernel-based) architecture is just <em>overhead</em>, and brings <em>no</em> functionality of any kind that couldn't be brought better-faster-cheaper otherwise. The only advantage of it is for throwing off a running implementation quicker, which is good in early design/alpha-test stage, but should certainly not be made a standard interface that would prevent further improvements. See <a class="internal" href="no-kernel.html" >no-kernel</a> systems.
<p>Runtime software decentralization can be implemented efficiently with a reflective architecture: the system can abstract any part of itself (whether by ability or by a priori assistance) and further replace it. Then a runtime <a class="internal" href="code_20generation.html" >code generator</a> (that itself can be replaced/upgraded) will replace all of interpreter, compiler, linker, <a class="internal" href="kernel.html" >kernel</a>, etc. Functionality (including <a class="internal" href="higher-order.html" >higher-order</a>) all goes into libraries, where it belongs.<hr><p><b>This page is linked from: </b> <a class="internal" href="publicity.html" >Publicity</a> &nbsp; </DIV></BODY></HTML>
