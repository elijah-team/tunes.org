<p><BLOCKQUOTE>
[..] I remember the attempts in <a class="internal" href="apl.html" >APL</a> to "gentrify" the language to make it more accessible to people who were symbol-adverse. Even the small translators that replaced the <a class="internal" href="apl.html" >APL</a> symbols that were missing on ascii keyboards with @xx equivalents produced totally unreadable code.

<p>There is a good <STRONG><a class="internal" href="psychology_20of_20programming.html" >psychological</a></STRONG> reason for this that I learned when studying <a class="internal" href="diagram.html" >graphical presentations</a>.  The more data you put into a single page, the easier people interpreted it.  The techniques we were exploring was to discover how we could put even <STRONG>more</STRONG> information on a single page.

<p>Humans have built-in pattern recognition capabilities at birth that operate well all of our lives.  Short-term and long-term memory must be learned and it is fragile ... we don't remember very well.

<p>Once you become familiar with the <a class="internal" href="k.html" >K</a> idiom patterns, you can read code more quickly because we employ pattern recognition rather than memory to read the code;  the patterns are evident on a single page, and you must use memory if the code exceeds your visual range.
