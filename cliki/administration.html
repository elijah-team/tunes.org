>The <a class="internal" href="political_20term.html" >political term</a> for the act of managing information about people or computer objects, that is not directly needed as an important result, but is useful to achieve proper scheduling. <a class="internal" href="administration.html" >Administration</a> also refers to the entity and organization, people or machine, individual or institution, that manages it.
<p>The role of the administration is not to decide, only to make <a class="internal" href="information.html" >information</a> available to all, and particularly to concerned people. On the basis of these pieces of information, decisions can be deduced straightforwardly by laws, or taken by the people and their representatives. Then these decisions may or not be applied by the administration itself, but only separate independent law-enforcing institutions, not the administration, should be allowed to use any kind of force should a conflict occur. 
<p>To sum it up, the role of administration is to collect and distribute information, which is publishing, not to create it, which would be <a class="internal" href="centralization.html" >centralization</a>.
<p>The right attitude is to bypass administration when it is not needed (that is, most of the time), but to gladly cooperate with it on a regular basis, because it can be helpful. 
<p>But administration is a tool. Letting it manage you leads you toward <a class="internal" href="centralization.html" >centralization</a>. So always do remember that administration is to serve <a class="internal" href="man.html" >man</a>, not man to serve administration.<hr><p><b>This page is linked from: </b> <a class="internal" href="committee.html" >Committee</a> &nbsp; <a class="internal" href="grain.html" >Grain</a> &nbsp; </DIV></BODY></HTML>
