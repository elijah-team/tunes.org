><strong>E</strong>xtendable multi<strong>U</strong>ser <strong>M</strong>icroprocessor <strong>EL</strong>an system, was an <a class="internal" href="os.html" >OS</a> by Jochen Liedtke, with <a class="internal" href="orthogonal_20persistence.html" >persistent</a> processes and data spaces, built to offer a standalone environment for the educational programming language ELAN. In the words of Roland McGrath:

<p><blockquote>
"...EUMEL, was based on two simple principles: <a class="internal" href="orthogonal_20persistence.html" >persistent</a> processes and data spaces. All data of the entire system including process control blocks and data space descriptors were contained in these data spaces. They could be copied efficiently and atomically using copy on write and <a class="internal" href="garbage_20collection.html" >garbage collection</a> techniques. By copying the "data space of data spaces" every few minutes, a complete copy of the entire system state was taken and lazily written out to disk. Thus, process persistence came for free (at least conceptually). Sending around data spaces in synchronous messages was the only means of process interaction which made it easy to build a simple distributed EUMEL system.  The paging device was a floppy disk (what else on a cheap computer at that time)."

<blockquote><h5>Abstract</h5>
Eumel and its advanced successor L3 are operating  systems built by GMD which have been used, for 13  years and 4 years respectively, as production systems  in business and education. More than 2000 Eumel systems and 500 L3 systems have been shipped since 1979  and 1988. Both systems rely heavily on the paradigm  of <a class="internal" href="orthogonal_20persistence.html" >persistent</a> (including <a class="internal" href="fault-tolerant.html" >fault-surviving</a> persistence).  Both data and processes, in principle all <a class="internal" href="object.html" >object</a>s are  persistent, files are implemented by means of persistent objects (not vice versa) etc.  In addition to the principles and mechanisms of Eumel/L3, general and specific experiences are described:  these relate to the design, implementation and maintenance of the systems over the last 13 years. For  general purpose timesharing systems the idea is powerful and elegant, it can be efficiently implemented, but  making a system really usable is hard work.
