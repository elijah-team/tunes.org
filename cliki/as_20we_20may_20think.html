>An <a class="internal" href="essay.html" >essay</a>, Vannevar Bush's 1945 vision about what computers should become. This relates somewhat to <a class="internal" href="user_20interface.html" >user interface</a>s.

<p>Excerpt from <A HREF="http://www.theatlantic.com/unbound/flashbks/computer/tech.htm">Prophets of the Computer Age</A
>, <em>The Atlantic Monthly</em>:

<p><blockquote>
In July, 1945, The Atlantic Monthly published "As We May Think," by Vannevar Bush, a former Massachusetts Institute of Technology president and Director of the wartime Office of Scientific Research and Development. In his article Bush urged scientists to turn their energies from war to the task of making the vast store of human knowledge accessible and useful. The "infostructure" Bush sketched out -- including a proposal for what might be seen as a kind of precursor to hypertext -- was destined to be realized in what we now know as the Internet. "As We May Think," in fact, is generally regarded by digerati as, if not the literal blueprint for the Net and the World Wide Web, then one of its germinal seeds. [..]
