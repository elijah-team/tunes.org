>The <a class="internal" href="political_20term.html" >political term</a> for that which rejects <a class="internal" href="tradition.html" >tradition</a>, somewhat regardless of whether it starts a perceived <a class="internal" href="revolution.html" >revolution</a>. Being revolutionary in that meaning doesn't mean that one rejects tradition per se, but some part of the current state of tradition.

<p>That which introduces drastic changes in the society: e.g. computers are a revolutionary invention; the ideas of Copernic were revolutionary.
