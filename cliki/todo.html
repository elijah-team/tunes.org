<p><ul>
<li>Rehaul the web site <A HREF="http://www.tunes.org">http://www.tunes.org</A
>.
Update the information, make it more readable, make it easier for a reader to identify what is interesting to him, if anything.
<a class="internal" href="fare.html" >Far�</a>: I'll make a minimal update the site before march 2005. Time lacking, I won't do anything fancy, just a clarification. Help welcome: readers to detect bugs and opportunities for improvements, writers to add/fix contents, HTML workers to make it fancy (CSS, etc.), Lispers to migrate it to some CL-HTML
system, etc. Next step: change the main page to reflect recent changes.
<li><a class="internal" href="fare.html" >Far�</a>: before march 2005, I'll write an article about the dynamic point of view on computing vs the static "cult-of-the-dead" view on computing. Help welcome: bibliographical data.
<li><a class="internal" href="fare.html" >Far�</a>: I'll maintain an official TODO list for TUNES. Help welcome: edit it on the Cliki.
<li><a class="internal" href="fare.html" >Far�</a>: I'll start and maintain a list of "term projects" related to the
TUNES project. These should be coding projects that are doable by a
student in a few months, whether in an academic or an autodidactic
setting, and yield an immediately useful result. Your suggestions are
welcome, as are your volunteering for one of them. The page previously
announced on this list will serve as the basis for it:
  <A HREF="http://fare.tunes.org/computing/term-project-proposal.html">http://fare.tunes.org/computing/term-project-proposal.html</A
>
<li><a class="internal" href="fare.html" >Far�</a>: As far as my personal coding goes, I'll experiment further with the
CL fare-matcher and quasiquote implementation, and packaging it all
for asdf-install. Notable issues are the way that fare-matcher expands
intermediate bindings, the way that quasiquote can work with syntax
extension beyond sexp (things like vector, array or structure syntax).
The former is mostly an implementation refactoring issue (though with
implications in case fare-matcher is made to work with backtracking),
and the latter is an interesting semantic issue with implications in
any metalanguage. Help welcome: interesting tidbits on how this latter
issue is handled in other metalanguages.
<li>Write a <a class="internal" href="brief_20summary.html" >brief summary</a> for the main web page (without TUNES jargon!)  -done, check it out! -<a class="internal" href="tril.html" >Tril</a>
<li>Explain the details in the FAQ (again, in layman's terms)
<li>Create a list of interesting things to review. A blog of interesting articles to read? Then, we could comment on such papers as the following, and summarize their application to the tunes project:
<ul>
<li><A HREF="http://www-ppg.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/Publications/">The papers of the Persistence Group</A
>.
<li><A HREF="http://www.math.tau.ac.il/~laden/COP/">http://www.math.tau.ac.il/~laden/COP/</A
> [<a class="internal" href="mia.html" >MIA</a>?]
<li>(Add more here...)
</ul>
</ul>
I invite those of you who have interest in the TUNES project to help
me on these, to suggest improvements to this plan, and to chide me
should I fail to stand by it. You may also commit to doing things for
TUNES.
