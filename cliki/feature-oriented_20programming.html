<p>Excerpt from <em>Getting Started</em> below:
<blockquote>
<b>Feature Oriented Programming (<a class="internal" href="fop.html" >FOP</a>)</b> is the the study of feature modularity, where features are raised to first-class entities in design. Features are implemented by <b>cross-cuts</b> that are modifications or extensions to multiple classes. Unlike <a class="internal" href="aop.html" >AOP</a> aspects, whose focus is on quantification -- i.e., specifying predicates that identify join points at which to insert code -- feature implementations are actually much closer to <a class="internal" href="oo.html" >OO</a> framework designs. That is, to add a feature to an <a class="internal" href="oo.html" >OO</a> framework, there are predefined methods and classes that are to be extended. In such designs, there is little or no quantification, but there are indeed "cross-cuts". This is the approach that we have used for years in building program families (<a class="internal" href="aka.html" >aka</a> <b><a class="internal" href="product_20line.html" >product line</a>s</b>).
<p><b>Algebraic Hierarchical Equations for Application Design (AHEAD)</b> is an example of <a class="internal" href="fop.html" >FOP</a>. It is a simple and general <a class="internal" href="algebraic_20specification.html" >algebraic model of program synthesis</a> that is based on <b>step-wise refinement</b> -- a methodology that advocates that complex systems can be built by adding features incrementally. <a class="internal" href="fop.html" >FOP</a> and AHEAD address a fundamental problem in software engineering -- a path to its future.
<p><em>The future of software engineering is in automation</em>. The best practical example of automated software engineering is <a class="internal" href="relational.html" >relational</a> query optimization. That is, database queries are expressed using a <a class="internal" href="declarative.html" >declarative</a> specification (SQL) that is mapped to an efficient program. The general problem of mapping from a <a class="internal" href="declarative.html" >declarative</a> spec to a provably efficient program is very difficult -- it is called <b>automatic programming</b>). The success of <a class="internal" href="relational.html" >relational</a> databases rests on <a class="internal" href="relational.html" >relational</a> <a class="internal" href="algebra_20and_20coalgebra.html" >algebra</a> -- a set of fundamental operators on tables -- and that query evaluation programs are expressions -- compositions of <a class="internal" href="relational.html" >relational</a> <a class="internal" href="algebra_20and_20coalgebra.html" >algebra</a> operators. <a class="internal" href="optimizer.html" >Optimizer</a>s use algebraic identities to <a class="internal" href="rewrite_20for_20optimization.html" >rewrite</a>, and hence <a class="internal" href="optimize.html" >optimize</a>, expressions, which in turn <a class="internal" href="optimize.html" >optimize</a>s query evaluation programs. This is how databases "solve" the automatic programming problem for query evaluation programs.
