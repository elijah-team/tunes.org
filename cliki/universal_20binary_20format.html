>A <a class="internal" href="programming_20language.html" >programming language</a> for transporting and describing complex data structures across a network (<a class="internal" href="aka.html" >aka</a> <a class="internal" href="marshalling.html" >marshalling</a>).
<blockquote>
It has three components:
<p><ul>
<li>UBF(A) is a data transport format, roughly equivalent to well-formed <a class="internal" href="xml.html" >XML</a>.
<li>UBF(B) is a programming langauge for describing types in UBF(A) and protocols between clients and servers. UBF(B) is roughly equivalent to to Verified <a class="internal" href="xml.html" >XML</a>, <a class="internal" href="xml.html" >XML</a>-schemas, SOAP and WDSL.
<li>UBF(C) is a meta-level protocol between used between UBF servers.
</ul>
<p>While the <a class="internal" href="xml.html" >XML</a> series of languages had the goal of having a human readable format the UBF languages take the opposite view and provide a "machine friendly" format.
<p>UBF is designed to be easy to implement. As a proof of concept - UBF drivers for <a class="internal" href="erlang.html" >Erlang</a>, <a class="internal" href="mozart_2foz.html" >Oz</a>, <a class="internal" href="java.html" >Java</a> and <a class="internal" href="tcl.html" >TCL</a> can be found in the download area. [..]
<p>UBF is designed to be "language neutral" - UBF(A) defines a language neutral binary format for transporting data across a network. UBF(B) is a type system for describing client/server interactions which use UBF(A).
<p><h4>Programming by Contract</h4>
<p>Central to UBF is the idea of a "contract" which regulates the set of legal conversations that can take place between a client and a server.
<p>A software component (the contract checker) is place between a client and server which checks that all interactions between thew client and server are legal.

> excerpt:
<blockquote>
<h4>What is the relationship between UBF and <a class="internal" href="xml.html" >XML</a>?</h4>
<p>Both UBF and <a class="internal" href="xml.html" >XML</a> have similar goals and similar structure. <a class="internal" href="xml.html" >XML</a> has a <strong>supposedly</strong> human friendly syntax and is <strong>supposed</strong> to be self describing. UBF is programmer friendly and is designed to be efficient and easy to implement.
<p><h4>Why is UBF parsing efficient</h4>
<p><strong>UBF(A) terms are actually little programs which the decoder executes.</strong> When reconstructing a UBF(A) term the decoder just executes the program. No grammar checking or parsing is actually involved.
<p>UBF(A) encoded terms are also much more compact than the equivalent <a class="internal" href="xml.html" >XML</a> terms. Since parsing an import stream involves looking at every character on the input UBF parsing is intrinsically much more efficient than <a class="internal" href="xml.html" >XML</a> parsing. A UBF(A) encoder can also make intelligent use of the caching optimization to further improve efficiency.
