>An <a class="internal" href="object-oriented.html" >object-oriented</a> <a class="internal" href="programming_20language.html" >programming language</a> based on <a class="internal" href="smalltalk.html" >Smalltalk</a> syntax, <a class="internal" href="prototype-based.html" >prototype-based</a> object system, and multi-method dispatch, by <a class="internal" href="brian_20t._20rice.html" >Brian T. Rice</a> and <a class="internal" href="lee_20salzman.html" >Lee Salzman</a>. The intent is to provide an intermediate porting platform for the <a class="internal" href="tunes_20project.html" >TUNES Project</a>.
<p>The <a href="http://slate.tunes.org">home page</a> has most of the available documentation. The code is available via CVS.
<p>Some documents which indicate some of the directions being followed are the <A HREF="http://slate.tunes.org/doc/ui/">user interface architecture guide</A
>, and the <A HREF="http://slate.tunes.org/doc/mobius">implementation reference</A
> (both not entirely up to date).
<p><p class="comment">Note: The name Slate was originally used to name a "object-oriented <i>and</i> purely functional, Forth/Self/Beta/Lisp hybrid with <i>no syntax</i>", which was intended to be a <a class="internal" href="tunes_20hll.html" >TUNES HLL</a> (or HLL-) candidate. This project was eventually abandoned. The name was then recycled for the language (by the same authors) currently known as Slate. This current Slate language is <i>not at all</i> intended to be able to function as a HLL for Tunes; it probably doesn't even want to be directly associated with Tunes. In spite of this, it might anyway, when completed, loosely speaking be able to give some a little bit more concrete finger-pointings to some Tunes features than has previously existed, since it aims to be a refinement of the nicest things in the Self/Squeak/Lisp-machine tradition.</p>
<p><p class="comment"> For those who eventually for some kind of reason would be interested in the "original" Slate language: the information that is available exists scattered in mailing lists archives and tunes channel chat logs from around something of the years 2000-2001</p><hr><p><b>This page is linked from: </b> <a class="internal" href="activities.html" >Activities</a> &nbsp; <a class="internal" href="brian_20t._20rice.html" >Brian T.
