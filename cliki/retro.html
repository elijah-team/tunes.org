><a class="internal" href="tom_20novelli.html" >Tom Novelli</a>'s original "Retro" was a <a class="internal" href="forth.html" >FORTH</a>-based <a class="internal" href="os.html" >OS</a> and a prototype <a class="internal" href="low-level.html" >low-level</a> infrastructure for the <a class="internal" href="tunes_20project.html" >TUNES project</a>.
<p><A HREF="http://retroforth.org/">RetroForth</A
> is now developed and maintained by <a class="internal" href="charles_20childers.html" >Charles Childers</a>. It still aims to be simple and fun, but the emphasis is on "playing nicely" with popular OSes. It currently supports Linux, FreeBSD, Windows, BeOS, and DOS.
<p>While there is little interest in a Forth-OS for x86 hardware, Charles still enjoys playing with the Forth-OS idea. Recently a lot of development has gone into it, and it's now suitable for embedded x86 work. Others are seeking to use this as a basis for a more powerful operating system, but little progress has been made on that front.
<p>(Author's note: I abandoned Retro because FORTH did not live up to my original expectations. A FORTH compiler is just as complicated as any other compiler, but the language is difficult to use; other languages provide more "bang for the buck". It was also overwhelming to write a complete OS which wasn't usable until the whole thing was done.. this "revolutionary" approach was impractical, so I've dropped it in favor of making evolutionary changes to Linux.
