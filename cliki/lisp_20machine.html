>Lisp Machines were high-end workstations based on memory chips with tag bit support for various reasons, as well as a <a class="internal" href="risc.html" >RISC</a> <a class="internal" href="cpu.html" >CPU</a> specially microcoded to support infinite-precision arithmetic and other operations that made high-level dynamic languages such as  <a class="internal" href="lisp.html" >Lisp</a> and <a class="internal" href="prolog.html" >Prolog</a> execute much faster and more safely than on ordinary machines. The primary purpose of this architecture was to allow the systems programmers to concentrate on developing high-level, well-integrated environments and tools, which succeeded in some sense. However, the economics of this architecture rapidly became untenable, and the companies that produced them went out of business.
