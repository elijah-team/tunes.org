>A <a class="internal" href="term.html" >term</a>: we say that <strong>A</strong> <em>is orthogonal to</em> <strong>B</strong> if you don't have to think about feature A while thinking about feature B.

<p>This is desirable because humans aren't good at reasoning about more than one thing at a time.

<p><a class="internal" href="c_2b_2b.html" >C++</a>, for example, embodies lack of orthogonality in language features. It's like a swiss army knife with all blades soldered in open position; you can do lots of things with it, but everytime you use one feature, the other ones get in the way.

<p><blockquote>Experienced <a class="internal" href="c_2b_2b.html" >C++</a> developers know that understanding inline functions and understanding virtual destructors does not necessarily mean you understand inline virtual destructors. Such battle-scarred developers recognize that comprehending the interactions between the features in <a class="internal" href="c_2b_2b.html" >C++</a> is of the greatest possible importance in using the language effectively.
<br>-- Scott Meyers, <u>Effective C++</u>

<p>At the other end of the spectrum, <a class="internal" href="ocaml.html" >OCAML</a> is a language with a lot of orthogonality in features, and it's like a tool box where you can choose the right tools for the right job, and leave the other ones in the box.
