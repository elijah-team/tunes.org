>Note that adapting formal reasoning applies to the field of mathematics, and doesn't apply as such to the real world: there is a quantum duality between reality and understandability, so that there is a limit to the combined reality and understandability of a phenomenon; the more you can understand it, the less it can be considered as real; the more real it is, the less it can be understood; happily this doesn't show for classical phenomenon (because we are part of the world, and global as well as local information is conserved and/or decreasing, any information that is communicated to us from the rest of the world implies that at least as much information disappeared from the world). Still, in a way, the only real world that our mind can grasp at all, is the part that is understandable; that which can't be understood, which can't be spoken, well, we may consider is the "noise" of the universe. We might want to quotient reality by equivalence up to noiseful events; however, reality is such that if any noiseful event is admitted, then the resulting quotient is trivial, for we have no absolute knowledge that allows us to formally distinguish between two realities; so we must quotient by equivalence up to "small enough" noiseful events, and our criterion for smallness of such events has to be an a priori hypothesis that makes the resulting structure not fully real.
