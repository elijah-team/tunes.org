>Mathematica is a scientific calculation package, which contains a <a class="internal" href="computer_20algebra_20system.html" >Computer Algebra System</a>, developed by Wolfram Research.
<p>Mathematica is an impressive piece of software, because contrary to other technical symbolic calculation software, it is based on a real, well-designed <a class="internal" href="programming_20language.html" >programming language</a>, hence can be extended in ways both clean and advanced, allowing for incremental enhancements. Thus, even if a given version of Mathematica does a few things not as well as a rival software, Mathematica will win on its overall capabilities, and can easily be made to further scale up on the long run, whereas the rival software just can't adapt.
<p>Unhappily, it is expensive proprietary software only, thus cannot benefit from open development in a free world. This is a very sad situation, as the world really needs some reliable, free (for in the software world, freedom is the way to optimize reliability), symbolic calculation software.
<p>Mathematica is available for <a class="internal" href="linux.html" >Linux</a> as well as for lesser platforms.
<p>On the other hand, I've been told that I was overly generous towards Mathematica (partly because I didn't use it deeply enough to see its shortcomings, whereas Maple disgusted me).
