><A HREF="http://kogs-www.informatik.uni-hamburg.de/~moeller/symbolics-info/genera/genera.html">Genera</a> is the <a class="internal" href="os.html" >OS</a> that runs on Symbolics <a class="internal" href="lisp_20machine.html" >Lisp Machine</a>s; it also runs under hardware emulators for Mac, and under a software emulator on 64-bit Alpha machines.

<p>To answer an obvious question, the software emulator only runs on 64-bit processors because the tagged-memory architecture of Symbolics machines used 40-bit words with 36 of those bits for actual data. Emulating this on a common 32-bit machine is prohibitive to say the least.

<p>The product is not actively developed anymore, but is still serviced, and it still does amazing things that have been lost since the times of <a class="internal" href="lisp_20machine.html" >Lisp machine</a>s. Being a <a class="internal" href="lisp.html" >Lisp</a>-based open system, it's an example of a <a class="internal" href="no-kernel.html" >no-kernel</a> system. It also has a tightly-integrated system of interface, first developed as Dynamic Windows which later developed into <a class="internal" href="clim.html" >CLIM</a>. The system is still used for Common Lisp and other language development in modern times simply for the development environment and intelligent interface systems.

<p>Some significant features of it which are non-obvious to outsiders include versioning built into the file system, support for many different programming languages, support for several different memory-allocation schemes (using memory-region allocation and referencing), and a low-level version of Lisp for controlling the boot sequence and configurations of hardware.

<p>The Mac-Version is not a hardware emulator. It is a real Ivory-processor on a real Lisp machine Nubus board.<hr><p><b>This page is linked from: </b> <a class="internal" href="lispos.html" >LispOS</a> &nbsp; <a class="internal" href="microkernel_20debate.html" >Microkernel Debate</a> &nbsp; </DIV></BODY></HTML>
