>A <a class="internal" href="microsoft.html" >Microsoft</a> <a class="internal" href="programming_20language.html" >Programming Language</a> favored by developers for its ease of use (often billed as <a class="internal" href="rapid_20application_20development.html" >Rapid Application Development</a> or <a class="internal" href="rad.html" >RAD</a> capabilities). These include features of both the <a class="internal" href="ide.html" >IDE</a> such as drag-n-drop <a class="internal" href="gui.html" >GUI</a> building tools and tightly integrated debugging support as well as language features such as a syntax based on the original <a class="internal" href="basic.html" >BASIC</a> which is easy to learn, read and use. Visual Basic is widely acknowledged as one of the best systems for using and building certain categories of <a class="internal" href="com.html" >COM</a> components. Due to early interpreted and pseudo-compiled versions, the language acquired a reputation for poor performance, but particularly in later releases which introduced true compilation and agressive optimizations borrowed from Microsoft's <a class="internal" href="c_2b_2b.html" >C++</a> compilers, this has been disproven for most common usage scenarios (such as business applications). Version 7 moves VB to the <a class="internal" href="_.net.html" >.NET</a> platform which means compiled VB code is identical to other compiled languages targeted to the .NET <a class="internal" href="clr.html" >CLR</a>. For many years, VB was the language of choice for corporate line of business applications, but with the increasing popularity of <a class="internal" href="java.html" >Java</a>, the release of .NET and the carefully-designed <a class="internal" href="c_23.html" >C#</a> language, the popularity of VB appears to be on the decline.
