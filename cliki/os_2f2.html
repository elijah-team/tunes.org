>IBM's <A HREF="http://www-4.ibm.com/software/os/warp/">OS/2 Warp</A

is one branch of what was originally a joint development between
<A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com">Microsoft</A
> and
<A HREF="http://www.ibm.com">IBM</A
>, the other branch being known today as
Microsoft Windows NT. It can run most <a class="internal" href="dos.html" >DOS</a> and Win 3.x programs seamlessly, as well as some Win9x software.
<p>While not abandoned by IBM, it is not very actively marketed by them anymore.
However, a company has licensed the right to market an up-to-date OEM version of OS/2: <A HREF="http://www.ecomstation.com">eComStation</A
>.
<p>Also, OS/2 has long been actively supported by a legion of developer-users and enthusiasts, and good development information is available on the
<A HREF="http://www.teamos2.org/apps/development.html">Team OS/2</A
> and
("Seattle OS/2  users group" | http://www.seaos2.org/refs/develop.html) <a class="internal" href="mia.html" >MIA</a>
sites.
<p>FTP sites for OS/2 software:

>, ("FTP-OS/2" | ftp://ftp-os2.cdrom.com) <a class="internal" href="mia.html" >MIA</a>
<p>UPDATE:
<p>IBM has announced that OS/2 is now truly dead, about 2 weeks after M$ declared that MS-DOS, Win 3.X, Win 95, and Win NT 3.X dead, on 01/01/03.
OS/2, you may recall, is WinNT's not-so-evil twin.<hr><p><b>This page is linked from: </b> <a class="internal" href="microsoft_20windows.html" >Microsoft Windows</a> &nbsp; </DIV></BODY></HTML>
