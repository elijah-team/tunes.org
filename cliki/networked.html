>For an entity in a system, the <a class="internal" href="term.html" >term</a> for being linked to other entities, that is, there being <a class="internal" href="input.html" >input</a> and <a class="internal" href="output.html" >output</a> between the entity and others, faster than the speed that the entity can stabilize.
<p>For a system, having entities linked with each other.
<p>In a common, restricted meaning for systems, implies that little trust exists between the entities, and/or that the system is organized in a centralized way, and programmers only having access to very low-level communication primitives, and having to hand-design the way <a class="internal" href="information.html" >information</a> is organized in the system (which is also a form of <a class="internal" href="centralization.html" >centralization</a>, as a one brain decides for all the system).
