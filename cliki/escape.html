>A <a class="internal" href="term.html" >term</a> for a way to exit the current or normal <a class="internal" href="context.html" >context</a>. When quoting text, special character sequences may be used to make the difference between what is part of the text being quoted, and what part of the text quoting it.

<p><a class="internal" href="terminal.html" >Terminal</a>s use escape sequences to indicate things other than usual text, such as moving the cursor, changing the color of the text, etc. 

<p>A <a class="internal" href="reference.html" >reference</a> to an object is said to escape a <a class="internal" href="scope.html" >scope</a> if some objects outside of this scope may access it (for instance, because this reference was passed to an external procedure that may have had the side-effect of storing it). 

<p>An object is said to escape a <a class="internal" href="scope.html" >scope</a> when at least one reference to this object escapes the scope.

<p>Many program transformations including <a class="internal" href="garbage_20collection.html" >garbage collection</a> and various optimizations, depend on the ability to prove that some objects do not escape. 

<p>For instance, an efficient implementation for non-escaping objects would be to allocate them in a stack, and pop them out of existence when the function exits. Escaping objects, on the other hand, would require more expensive heap-allocation, with sophisticated garbage collection techniques.</DIV></BODY></HTML>
