Ok, so once in a while, we'll organize a Tunes Sprint so as to speed up development by bringing together the focused attention of many <a class="internal" href="contributor.html" >contributor</a>s on some hot subject. 
<p>First sprint is sunday 2002-09-01 (that's today). It will start at 09:30 French time (07:30 UTC, 00:30 US/Pacific time), and finish 12 hours from then. This page will show progress, and so will IRC logs from #tunes on irc.openprojects.net. 
<p>Armin and I (<a class="internal" href="fare.html" >Faré</a>) are both in Paris, and we intend to define some core for the <a class="internal" href="metaprogramming.html" >metaprogramming</a> infrastructure: a <a class="internal" href="mop.html" >MOP</a> for defining and using <a class="internal" href="linear_20graph_20reduction.html" >Linear Graph Reduction</a> virtual machines. Ideally, the specification will result in a test suite that can be used to check the (partial) correctness of the implementation that we intend to do in the coding sprint, beginning two weeks afterwards.
<p>See these notes by Armin: <A HREF="http://bespin.org/~arigo/">http://bespin.org/~arigo/</A
>.
<p>Additional notes by <a class="internal" href="fare.html" >Faré</a>: Need to distinguish between compile-time meta-level and run-time meta-level. Two different prefixes should be used instead of the same "meta". The "ultimate" compile-time meta-level ought to be a reflective framework. The "ultimate" run-time meta-level is the bare underlying hardware. 
<p><a class="internal" href="water.html" >Water</a> suggests to consider <a class="internal" href="ap5.html" >AP5</a> for relational specifications, <a class="internal" href="maude.html" >Maude</a> and <a class="internal" href="bobj.html" >BOBJ</a> for rewrite logic, <a class="internal" href="tigre.html" >TIGRE</a> for <a class="internal" href="graph_20reduction.html" >Graph Reduction</a> implementation, and more... Maybe merging Maude and BOBJ already gives most of what we need? Read the Maude book "Reflection in Rewriting Logic". 
<p><a class="internal" href="fare.html" >Faré</a>: for a runtime <a class="internal" href="mop.html" >MOP</a>, a few things we want to see: 1) active graphs can be stopped at the proper runtime metalevel 2) stopped graphs can be manipulated in the following ways 
<p><ol>
<li>synchronize to some state that is meaningful for interpretation as a higher-level graph (as specified by the source code) 
<li>"serialization" or otherwise interpretation into actual data structures interpretable at the higher abstraction level 
<li>enumerating the "ports" of the graph, i.e. links between internal nodes and external graphs 
<li>applying some evaluation rules (internal transformations and communication) 
<li>reactivating the graph with some given strategy using the above rules 
<li>listing invariants of the graph (preconditions and postconditions) 
<li>listing "variants" of the graph (i.e. some rules that constrain the way the graph must progress from now to further observable stops) 
</ol>
<p>1,2, and 3 are completely related to allowing meta-level compile-time correspondances, without having to stop compilation at some virtual machine that hardwires the abstraction level to a given graph representation. 
<p>Armin: one of the goals is to be able to specify integers as Peano integers, yet have an efficient bignum implementation, in a way that allows for reasoning to take place at the Peano level. <a class="internal" href="fare.html" >Faré</a>: i.e. as was done in Weyrauch's FOL.
