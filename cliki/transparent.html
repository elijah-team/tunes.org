>A <a class="internal" href="term.html" >term</a> indicating a feature of a software component whose behavior, i.e., whose <a class="internal" href="semantics.html" >semantics</a>, is not influenced by some aspect. Its opposite is <a class="internal" href="aware.html" >aware</a>.

<p>For instance, remote procedure call/method invocation purposes to make procedure call/method invocation location-transparent. By converse, code <a class="internal" href="migration.html" >migration</a> is usually location-aware (you specify where you want to move code/state, or from where you want to pull it, often in the very same code which moves).

<p>Often, transparency also means that you also cannot make it explicit, even though you may want to. Via <a class="internal" href="reflection.html" >reflection</a>, this kind of expressive limit can be overcome.  

<p>A technique specifically thought to "isolate" different concerns, program them independently with a domain-specific language, and combine them in the final program is <a class="internal" href="aspect-oriented_20programming.html" >aspect-oriented programming</a>.

<p><span class="comment">I've replaced the previous definition with one which seems to me more accurate. I report the previous one in the case someone does not agree: A term for a software feature that is implicit, in that you don't have to care about it or even ask for it. -- <a class="internal" href="schizophonic.html" >schizophonic</a>
