<p>FPGAs are generally slower than their ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit) counterparts, and draw more power. However, they have several advantages such as a shorter time-to-market, and lower development costs (for quantities < 10k). An ASIC can be made that is a so-called hard copy of an FPGA - that is, an integrated circuit with the same functionality as the FPGA, but faster and consuming less power. 
<p>Many modern FPGAs have the ability to be reprogrammed at 'run time', and this is leading to the idea of reconfigurable computing or reconfigurable systems - CPUs that reconfigure themselves to suit the task at hand. Software-configurable microprocessors such as Stretch's S5000 adopt a hybrid approach by providing a processor core and an FPGA core on the same chip. 
<p>Applications of FPGAs include DSP, Software-defined radio, Aerospace and defence systems, ASIC Prototyping, Medical imaging and a growing range of other areas. 
<p>To define the behaviour of the FPGA it is required to use a <a class="internal" href="hardware_20description_20language.html" >Hardware Description Language</a> (HDL) or a schematic designed using an Electronic design automation tool. Either of these, when compiled, will generate a net list, that can be mapped to the actual fpga architecture. When done the binary file generated is used to (re)configure the FPGA device. Common HDL's are <a class="internal" href="vhdl.html" >VHDL</a> and Verilog.

Basic process technology types
<ul>
<li>SRAM - based on static memory technology. In-system programmable and re-programmable. Requires external boot devices. Usually CMOS. 
<li>Anti-fuse - One-time programmable. CMOS. 
<li>EPROM - Electrically Programmable Read-Only Memory technology. Usually one-time programmable in production because of plastic packaging. Windowed devices can be erased with ultraviolet (UV) light. CMOS. 
<li>EEPROM - Electrically Eraseable Programmable Read-Only Memory technology. Can be erased, even in plastic packages. Some, but not all, EEPROM devices can be in-system programmed. CMOS. 
<li>FLASH - Flash-erase EPROM technology. Can be erased, even in plastic packages. Some, but not all, FLASH devices can be in-system programmed. Usually, a FLASH cell is smaller than an equivalent EEPROM cell and is therefore less expensive to manufacture. CMOS. 
<li>Fuse - One-time programmable. Bipolar
