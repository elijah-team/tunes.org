>I would guess this is an already known model, with some links on the net
somewhere. Anyway, as I begin to hate the way windows navigation works under
current implementations, I'd like to really suggest people facing the task
of choosing a way use to navigate through windows a simple way.

<p>In fact,I think I hate windows in the first place and that they should be
removed and that we should use full-screen windows. Anyway, I think my model
could be use with current windows interfaces too.

<p>Like I said, I say my model, because I don't know people that have described
it before, even if I guess it already exist.

<p>I suggest that the windowing system have two kind of creation:
create_sister_window and create_child_window. And that all childs of a
windows, be linked in a circular linked-list. That way, one would have a
previous key, and a next key to go through the childs windows. What need
to ne added is an up key to go to the parent window, and I guess a close-window
key would be nice too.

<p>That's it, nothing more complicated than that!

<p>I also believe that for each windows created, one would choose if the
underlying process must continue, or be stopped when the windows lost
focus.

<p>That is so simple, that I feel stupid to write a node to suggest this.<hr><p><b>This page is linked from: </b> <a class="internal" href="windowing_20system.html" >windowing system</a> &nbsp; </DIV></BODY></HTML>
