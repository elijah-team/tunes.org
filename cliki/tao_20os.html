Without having time to write a decent summary, here's a 1994 article from the
BYTE magazine.  Even though Tao OS/Elate/Intent has progressed in the 10
years since this article was written, this still seems to be a good introduction
to the basics.

<p>It's a pity that the multi-processor capability has never been seriously used to
my knowledge.  Also note that the AmigaDE (or whatever they call it tomorrow)
is an attempty to build a (proprietry) scalable OS ontop of the Tao OS.
