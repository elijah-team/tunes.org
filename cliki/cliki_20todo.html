><h2>Appearance</h2>
<p>Modify the CSS and/or source to have a better appearance.</p>
<p>Re-defun the functions that use the original with-page-surround macro instead of our patched version.</p>
<h2>Backups</h2>
<p>Enter the files into Tunes' CVS.</p>
<h2>Infobot Integration</h2>
An access function is already implemented as "cto $foo". What remains:
<ul>
<li>Import rest of the relevant <A HREF="../~nef/abi/factoids.txt">the factoids</A
>.
<li>Add an interface to the search function, perhaps showing the returned values directly instead of printing the URL equivalent.
<li>Add a way to summarize any node, using topic annotations and external links. The key function is a summary, which may just have to be the first line of the node or some extra annotation. <span class="comment">Using a SPAN tag with class "summary" is an option, but it requires too much manual work and extra storage.</span> <span class="comment" style="color: DarkGreen">Another option is to use <A HREF="http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?SectionedPage">sectioned pages</A
></span>
</ul>
<h2>CLiki</h2>
<ul>
<li>Modify Araneida to use PAServe's url-parsing logic... basically, fix it.
<li>Make sure that any characters that are not proper file name characters are URL-escaped. Also, be sure to reverse-translate the escaping.
<li>Track (con-)current edits with hidden form values and merge them with a diff-style system.
<li>Add the simplest authentication scheme possible.
<li>Automate the backup system, and eventually include a reversion mechanism.
<li>Add a web interface for controlling the Foo.titles file contents.
<li>Fix up the page-creation routines so that all of the previous references to that page that were broken get counted in its references table.
<li>Adjust the all-pages display so that it shows the Foo.titles variants. It currently shows duplicates.
<li>Show a link that displays the edit history, if not the revisions, for the current page. <span class="comment">Implemented, but only shows up to 60 results; any more requires some logic adjustments.</span> (Lost in the merge with Cliki CVS - has to be ported from water's source.)
<li>Sort the list of "Pages in this topic"
<li>Provide a text links database URL so that cliki can be browsed using <a href="http://touchgraph.sourceforge.net/">TouchGraph</a> <a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/touchgraph/TGWB_102.zip">WikiBrowser</a>.
The format of a line in the links database is:
<pre>node-name [node-linked-to ...] [url-linked-to ...]
</pre>
</ul>
<h2>Content</h2>
<ul>
<li>Finish moving over and verifying the ad hoc information on the Tunes Review for Languages, Reflection, and Migration methods.
<li>Make sure people know how to use the <a class="internal" href="topic.html" >topic</a>s properly, and keep the set of topics understandable and small (help!! They're growing!).
