>The CLiki search field takes in a number of keyword arguments, and computes a relevance for all the pages based on how often and how uniquely they occur (common terms will give a random ordering).
<p>The results pages will also show what terms were important to the ranking and the context of their occurrence.
<p>It should also be noted that performing a Google query using "site:cliki.tunes.org" along with the desired keywords actually performs better, although the content there often lags the actual site's content by some weeks.</DIV></BODY></HTML>
