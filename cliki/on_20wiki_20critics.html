Old content:
<p>"Paul Dufresne dufrp@oricom.ca"
<p>Well, I think the ability to have anybody be able to contribute text
organised in a hierarchical way should not be underestimated.
<p>By the way I am the one who added [Really?] aside Fare comment that the
text was irreversible. Maybe I begin to understand that it is not so easy
to eliminate a page. But it is possible to modify text quite easily.
<p>As for being informed of new changes, there is now a nice section for
just that.
<p>"David Manifold dem@tunes.org"
<p>I have e-mailed the author of ThoughtsWeaver, a wiki clone that has e-mail notification of changes.  With his help it will be easier to add that feature to TunesWiki.  It could be done anyway by anyone who knows perl (hint, hint), which is everyone except me.
<p>More info on the e-mail notification in ThoughtsWeaver can be found at http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?ThoughtsWeaverAdditions .
