  >AtheOS</A> is a heavily multithreaded <a class="internal" href="os.html" >OS</a>, written from scratch, that supports SMP, TCP/IP, a fast <a class="internal" href="gui.html" >GUI</a>, and most of the useful <a class="internal" href="posix.html" >POSIX</a> functionality. It is released under the GPL. The project has been running for some years and has reached <strong>impressive</strong> functionality: a working system, and easy recompilation of most <a class="internal" href="unix.html" >Unix</a> programs with ./configure; make. While traditional in design, this system has been designed for the desktop, unlike traditional posixish OSes, and deserves attention.
<p>The AtheOS has been apparently been discontinued and a fork called SyllableOS has been started. The Syllable team has already completed a lot of major changes that make it more useable and up-to-date.
