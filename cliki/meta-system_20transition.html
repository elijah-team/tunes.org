>The <a class="internal" href="term.html" >term</a> for a theory being settled down by the
<a class="internal" href="principia_20cybernetica.html" >Principia Cybernetica</a> Project as "MetaSystem Transition theory"
(<a class="internal" href="mst.html" >MST</a> theory), that says that as the known world evolves toward more
complexity, it organizes into "higher" forms that let lower forms do
things, while they control things instead of doing them, that is,
that it evolves from systems to <a class="internal" href="meta-.html" >meta-</a>systems.
<p>The liberal/evolutionist/dynamicalsystemic analysis explains it in that 
relatively simple achievements in the meta-system yields great 
improvements in the system, or allow to achieve similar or greater 
results without spending as many resources, while developing 
capabilities that prove useful in quite many unsuspected domains, that 
allow to take advantage of new forms of free energy not yet rivaled 
upon.
<p>The development of the various forms of organizations known as life, 
from particles up to atoms (organizations of particles), up to molecules 
(organizations of atoms), up to simple organic molecules up to molecule 
complexes, protocells, and cells (organization of molecules), up to 
multicellular complexes and multicellular life forms (organization of 
living cells), up to life forms with specialized organs of increasing 
complexity (organization of organs), up to life forms with nervous 
systems (system to coordination organs), up to societies of above living 
creatures of various complexities, up to ecosystems, up to biospheres, 
up to the study and development of the above by human rationality, up to 
god knows what will follow next, all that makes an overwhelming witness 
for that theory. As for computing, all this means that people, after 
having developed analog devices, have developed analog device 
components, which led them to digital device components, and then to 
computer hardware development, to binary software programming, to
macro-<a class="internal" href="assembly.html" >assembly</a> software programming, to <a class="internal" href="programming_20languages.html" >programming languages</a> (initial 
<a class="internal" href="lisp.html" >Lisp</a> notation), to interpreters, to compilers (<a class="internal" href="fortran.html" >Fortran</a>), to
<a class="internal" href="low-level.html" >low-level</a> languages (<a class="internal" href="c_20language.html" >C language</a>), to medium-level languages (<a class="internal" href="ml.html" >ML</a>; 
<a class="internal" href="lisp.html" >Lisp</a> has been all the way down to here). TUNES promotes next meta-
system transition in computing, what we call <a class="internal" href="high-level.html" >high-level</a> languages, 
and <a class="internal" href="metaprogramming.html" >metaprogramming</a>.
<p>Meta-system transition does not mean that there is a pure cut between 
the system and the "<a class="internal" href="meta-.html" >meta-</a>system", which would exist independently, or 
"detach" from lower dependencies. Actually, the "lower" system is never 
so active as when the meta-system exists, and the meta-system does 
depends on this increased activity (that it in turn generates) to even 
exist, it feeds on it, and promotes it: cellular life has not 
disappeared but multiplied since multicellular life appeared; the 
currently single known reasoning species (<a class="internal" href="man.html" >man</a>) has not had a less 
active, but a much more active material life, since it developed its 
spiritual skills and activities; much more people (not counting 
programs) do assembly programming since interpreters and compilers where 
invented.<hr><p><b>This page is linked from: </b> <a class="internal" href="mst.html" >MST</a> &nbsp; <a class="internal" href="reflective_20tower.html" >Reflective Tower</a> &nbsp; <a class="internal" href="self-extensible.html" >Self-extensible</a> &nbsp; <a class="internal" href="valentin_20f._20turchin.html" >Valentin F.
