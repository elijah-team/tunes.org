>The <a class="internal" href="political_20term.html" >political term</a> for the application of the theories of <a class="internal" href="liberalism.html" >Liberalism</a> to the computing world. It proclaims that only through <a class="internal" href="computing_20freedom.html" >computing freedom</a> can the computing world achieve power, performance and reliability.
<p>The arguments for liberalism have been sufficiently developed since the late seventeenth century, and have proven generic enough (see <a class="internal" href="cybernetics.html" >Cybernetics</a>), so that we do not have to repeat them extensively. We just need to point out that the same arguments apply to the computer market as well as any market.
<p>This means people in the computer world, producers as well as consumers, must have access to real <a class="internal" href="information.html" >information</a>, not advertisement or propaganda, and be free to discuss computer problems and acquire computer education, so that there would be <a class="internal" href="fair_20competition.html" >fair competition</a>, which will yield the best possible result, not wild competition that leads to monopolies.
<p>For competition to be the fairest and the most active, it should happen at the finer possible <a class="internal" href="grain.html" >grain</a> of software, with optimal <a class="internal" href="security.html" >security</a>.
