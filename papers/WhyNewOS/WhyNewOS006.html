<H2><A NAME="htoc33">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Conclusion</H2>
The ideas exposed in this article are not new.
Since the seventeenth century,
political thinkers, economists, physicists, biologists,
have discovered them,
which led to theories of democracy, liberalism, thermodynamics, darwinism.
The unification of these into a same set of principles,
under a more general theory of information,
is not foreign to the appearance of computer technology,
from the early essays of Leibniz on automatas,
to Wiener's Cybernetics.<BR>
<BR>
The point of the Tunes project is not to claim to have invented any of these,
neither is it to claim to realize anything technologically original.
The claim of this article is
to consistently acknowledge the validity of these principles
in the computer world that is so well suited to experiment them,
by its very principle of manipulating information exactly.<BR>
<BR>
The Tunes project will try to provide an initial software frame for
reliable distributed information to exist,
that is all the more needed that the necessary hardware is already available
and underexploited by people following
the transient external aspects of tradition
instead of its stable roots.<BR>
