<H1>Legal Documents Relative to the TUNES Project</H1>
<!--#include virtual="header.html" -->
<p>We would have liked to put the whole project under John Carter's
  <A HREF="http://www.geocities.com/SoHo/Cafe/5947/bugroff.html">bugroff license</A> (local <A HREF="bugroff.html">copy</A>),
but we fear that this would limit the availability of our software and ideas.
We fight for a world where such a license would be effectively possible,
and the way we did was by committing ourselves to the
	<A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GNU GPL</A> and
	<A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lesser.html">GNU LGPL</A>,
that turn the copyright system against those that use it
to limit other people's freedom to use, modify, and share software.</p>
