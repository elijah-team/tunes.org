    <h1>The "No problem Bugroff" license.</h1>

    <p>Richard Stallman of the <a href="http://www.gnu.org">Free
	Software Foundation</a> devised, in addition to some marvelous
	software, the GNU General Public License (GPL for short). Or
	the CopyLeft it is sometimes called.</p>

    <p>It is quite a revolutionary document, using the "copyright"
      tool to to protect your right to use free software.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately using copyright to protect free software is a lot
      like using a Jackal to guard the hens.</p>

    <p>In fact, various inconveniences relating to this have resulted
      in modifications such as the LGPL (Library General Public
      License) and more recently the <a
      href="http://www.mozilla.org">NPL (Netscape Public
      License)</a></p>

    <p>I call these matters mere inconveniences, the real damage will
      occur when the Jackal's, (sorry, I mean lawyers), actually get
      to test the GPL in court for the first time.</p>

    <p>Thus enter my version.</p>

    <p>Its very simple.</p>

    <p>Entirely consistent.</p>

    <p>Completely unrestrictive.</p>

    <p>Easy to apply.</p>

    <p>The "No problem Bugroff" license is as follows...</p>

    <p>The answer to any and every question relating to the copyright,
      patents, legal issues of Bugroff licensed software is....</p>

    <p><strong>Sure, No problem. Don't worry, be happy. Now bugger
	off.</strong></p>


    <p>All portions of this license are important..</p>

    <ul>
      <li>"Sure, no problem." Gives you complete freedom. I mean
	it. Utterly complete. A bit of a joke really. You have
	complete freedom anyway.</li>

      <li>"Don't worry, be happy." Apart from being good advice and a
	good song, it also says :- No matter what anyone else says or
	does, you still have complete freedom.</li>

      <li>Now bugger off. The only way to get rid of pushy Jackals is
	to ignore them and not feed them. The GPL is just begging
	somebody to take it to court. Can't you just see it. Exactly
	the same thing that happened when some twit (not Linus)
	registered Linux as his own personal trademark. People got
	upset, started a fund, and hired, off all ruddy things, a
	Jackal to try and defend the chicken! Who really benefits from
	this trademark / patent / copyright thing anyway? The
	lawyers. Who made it up in the first place? The lawyers.</li>

    </ul>

    <p>OK so the last part of the license sounds a bit harsh, but
      seriously folks, if you are a :-</p>

    <ul>
      <li> Lawyer asking these legalese questions... You should go off
	and learn an honest trade that will actually contribute to
	life instead of draining it.</li> 

      <li> Programmer asking these legalese questions... You have
	amazingly powerful tools in your hands and mind, use them to
	ask and answer the worthwhile questions of life, the universe
	and everything. Stop mucking about with such legal nonsense
	and get back to programming.</li>

      <li> User/reader asking these question... Don't worry. Go off
	and be happy. Have fun. Enjoy what has been created for
	you.</li>
    </ul>
