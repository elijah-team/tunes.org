This notion generalizes over several more commonly-known methods that are often not distinguished from evaluation itself. In this sense, dispatch is complementary to <a class="internal" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050414221942/http://cliki.tunes.org/rewrite">rewrite</a>.

<p>A function definition is a fairly common part of many programming languages. However, the rules for how definitions are composed into a whole vary widely. The following spectrum is arrayed in increasing range of expressiveness:
<ol>
<li>Lexically-scoped procedural languages in general will require exactly one definition per name of a function, possibly allowing for lexically-scoped overriding of the definition.
<li><a class="internal" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050414221942/http://cliki.tunes.org/Object-oriented">Object-oriented</a> programming languages have a variety of arranged schemes for polymorphic dispatch, depending on the object model:
<ul>
<li>Single-dispatch versus multiple-dispatch: whether the first argument or all the arguments are consulted for dispatch.
<li>Single inheritance versus multiple inheritance or mixin-based overrides.
<li>Dispatch on classes versus instances.
<li>Predicate dispatch (only really deployed in <a class="internal" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050414221942/http://cliki.tunes.org/Cecil">Cecil</a>).
<li>Various forms of combination options for functions, whether termed <em>inner</em> calls, <em>super</em> calls, <em>resends</em>, <em>before/after</em>-calls, or <em>around</em> calls.
</ul>
<li><a class="internal" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050414221942/http://cliki.tunes.org/Functional">Functional</a> programming languages use <a class="internal" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050414221942/http://cliki.tunes.org/pattern-matching">pattern-matching</a> to identify the applicable evaluation result. The advantage is that the expression value defined recursively is fully-available for inspection. Such languages can usually dispatch on types, structure, and value of their arguments.
<li>Logical programming languages generally specify a set of rules in an arbitrary sense which apply, and often define a strategy for traversing these rules which hopefully results in a terminating or at least manageable program. This process is often known as <a class="internal" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050414221942/http://cliki.tunes.org/unification">unification</a> as distinguished from pattern-matchers.
</ol>

<p>Each of these can generally express the previous one without emulation, but also requires a more sophisticated algorithm to manage efficiently.

<p>Of final note is that the specification of the traversal order of the functions is also included within this concept, through a meta-level protocol concerning the function definitions or the context within which the function definitions are entered.
