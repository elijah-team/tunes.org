<p>The basic unit of information is the chunk, which consists of content, time of occurrence and other attributes. However, all chunks are relative to a Lifestream and <a class="internal" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050211205825/http://cliki.tunes.org/Agent">Agent</a> (the minimal case being a unique chunk or chunk/stream/agent triple). Chunks can belong to many Lifestreams and have many associated <a class="internal" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050211205825/http://cliki.tunes.org/Agent">Agent</a>s. Many chunks do not have names. In general, naming is eschewed for attributes; naming is seen as costly to the user and often of little benefit, whereas many attributes can be inferred from context.

<p>Substreams (also called Lifestreams) are the basic organizational mechanism. Substreams are picked out of a parent Lifestream based on a set of search criteria. They live until they are killed, and update dynamically as more chunks are found or created. They can also be hidden.

<p>Hiding and killing are rarely done. More common is for a substream to fade into "the past." Past, present and future are relative to the system clock, which can be "dialed back/forward" to assume a new temporal viewpoint. This permits scheduling, among other things.

<p>"An <a class="internal" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050211205825/http://cliki.tunes.org/Agent">Agent</a>," say the designers, "is tied onto each infochunk the way a helium balloon might be tied down to a chunk of plastic-sort of." <a class="internal" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050211205825/http://cliki.tunes.org/Agent">Agent</a>s are the basic means of behavioral organization. They are responsible for organizing and updating substreams and provide a way for a Lifestreams terminal, or viewport, to communicate with outside systems like email. They can do things like scan other streams or systems for interesting events, or cooperate with other <a class="internal" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050211205825/http://cliki.tunes.org/Agent">Agent</a>s in producing present events or scheduling future ones.
