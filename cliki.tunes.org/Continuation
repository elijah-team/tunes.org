It can be seen as a function which also has a <a class="internal" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050205175809/http://cliki.tunes.org/side%20effect">side effect</a>, i.e. full replacement of the current evaluation <a class="internal" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050205175809/http://cliki.tunes.org/context">context</a> with another one. A continuation also accepts a parameter and functionally behaves as an identity, with the caveat that the produced value will be used in the context the continuation itself sets up. As an example, in a <a class="internal" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050205175809/http://cliki.tunes.org/LISP">LISP</a>-like language if <code>c</code> is a continuation storing the context <code>(+ 3 [])</code>, the evaluation of <code>(- 5 (c 2))</code> produces <code>(+ 3 2)</code>. Let us suppose that the evaluation strategy of the language selects the redex <code>(c 2)</code> to be evaluated. In first place, the evaluation context of the redex <code>(- 5 [])</code> is replaced with that stored in the continuation <code>(+ 3 [])</code>. In second place the functional evaluation of <code>(c 2)</code> is performed. We told that a continuation functionally behaves as an identity, and therefore the value <code>2</code> is produced. This value is put back in the evaluation context, which now is <code>(+ 3 [])</code>, and the resulting expression <code>(+ 3 2)</code> is evaluated. 

<p>Continuations as <a class="internal" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050205175809/http://cliki.tunes.org/object">object</a>s are powerful in that passing them around as arguments allows implementing very flexible control-flow structures; Essentially, they are <a class="internal" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050205175809/http://cliki.tunes.org/high-level">high-level</a> goto's. Continuations in most languages have a <a class="internal" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050205175809/http://cliki.tunes.org/security">security</a> flaw, however, since they are not implemented with <a class="internal" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050205175809/http://cliki.tunes.org/linear%20logic">linear</a> usage restrictions: A continuation may be freely (re-)evaluated by any part of the system that receives a reference to it.

<p>There is a means of implementing functional-style language using continuations as a low-level control-flow model, and a standard means of embedding normal lexical scoping in terms of it, called continuation-passing style.
