Though it is certainly more secure than systems with no <a class="internal" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050416153056/http://cliki.tunes.org/security">security</a> at all (e.g. MS-<a class="internal" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050416153056/http://cliki.tunes.org/DOS">DOS</a>), such finite <a class="internal" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050416153056/http://cliki.tunes.org/security">security</a> systems are just as insecure as soon as arises the need to share any data: whenever programs want to share data, one must blindly trust the others, because the finite <a class="internal" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050416153056/http://cliki.tunes.org/security">security</a> semantics cannot map the infinite semantics of actual problems.

<p>To circumvent this difficulty, many propose that no sharing be done; but then it is sometimes (it especially was in the time when no free <a class="internal" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050416153056/http://cliki.tunes.org/Unix">Unix</a> was available to the masses, and perhaps still is when few <a class="internal" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050416153056/http://cliki.tunes.org/user">user</a>s are concerned) better and cheaper to get a smaller machine for each human <a class="internal" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050416153056/http://cliki.tunes.org/user">user</a> than to get a big <a class="internal" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050416153056/http://cliki.tunes.org/centralized">centralized</a> one bogusly shared between them. Others (see <a class="internal" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050416153056/http://cliki.tunes.org/VSTa">VSTa</a>) have invented infinite protection systems, where <a class="internal" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050416153056/http://cliki.tunes.org/user">user</a>s can have sub-<a class="internal" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050416153056/http://cliki.tunes.org/user">user</a>s, which can in turn have sub-<a class="internal" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050416153056/http://cliki.tunes.org/user">user</a>s, and so on, recursively.

<p>While nobody can deny that such systems do restrict possible demises of the system, the kind of order enforced by such systems is very much that of a dictatorship, where power was left to a Leviathan to guarantee a civil peace, actually the peace of the dead.

<p>None of these protection schemes tackle the essential problem of <a class="internal" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050416153056/http://cliki.tunes.org/security">security</a>; they just add tremendous overhead to programming and program execution, without really solving anything, just postponing insecurity.

<p>TUNES despises such non-solutions to problems.

<p>Traditional systems also use the "<a class="internal" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050416153056/http://cliki.tunes.org/user">user</a>" concept as a way to have multiple (but statically many) differently customized versions of the system. 
In TUNES, there is no such concept of static "<a class="internal" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050416153056/http://cliki.tunes.org/user">user</a>" erected as a fundamental axiom of the system. Instead, actual human <a class="internal" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050416153056/http://cliki.tunes.org/user">user</a>s are free to define as many contexts as they like, to define variously specialized subcontexts indefinitely and dynamically. To the machine, no particular axiom is needed, the human <a class="internal" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050416153056/http://cliki.tunes.org/user">user</a> being just a common attribute to some contexts. As for human-<a class="internal" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050416153056/http://cliki.tunes.org/user">user</a>-wise <a class="internal" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050416153056/http://cliki.tunes.org/security">security</a>, the system allows these contexts to arbitrarily define lists of signatures or <a class="internal" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050416153056/http://cliki.tunes.org/capabilities">capabilities</a> as needed, and (dynamic)ally manage and share their resources at will. Again, <a class="internal" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050416153056/http://cliki.tunes.org/dynamism">dynamism</a> and <a class="internal" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050416153056/http://cliki.tunes.org/higher-order">higher-order</a> expressiveness, which allow adaptation, win over finite <a class="internal" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050416153056/http://cliki.tunes.org/static">static</a> allocation.<hr><p><b>This page is linked from: </b> <a class="internal" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050416153056/http://cliki.tunes.org/Capability">Capability</a> &nbsp; <a class="internal" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050416153056/http://cliki.tunes.org/ITS">ITS</a> &nbsp; </div><div id="footer"><form action="https://web.archive.org/web/20050416153056/http://cliki.tunes.org/admin/search"><a class="internal" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050416153056/http://cliki.tunes.org/edit/User%20Rights">Edit page</a> | <a class="internal" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050416153056/http://cliki.tunes.org/User%20Rights?source">View source</a> | Revisions: <b title="Fri, 03 Jan 2003 10:28:25 GMT">0</b>  | <input name="words" size="30"><input type="submit" value="search"></form><div id="disclaimer">CTO pages can be modified by anyone at anytime.
