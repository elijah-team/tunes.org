Configurations are basically the subject matter of a specification: a specification's expression can specify a number of objects to be involved and a certain amount of <a class="internal" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050414223358/http://cliki.tunes.org/higher-order">higher-order</a> information about them and the operations upon them.

<p>Traditional systems can be described as consisting of certain objects present in certain slots in a global namespace object or structure, and operations defined on those in certain ways in order to say that "feature X is implemented".

<p>The term arises from common software terminology since it accurately described a certain state of the world, and works at different levels: people use it for options and their values in files as well as directory structures and permissions at the large scale. For TUNES, it's a bit more general, because attributes are <em>not</em> just slots. In fact, they can be anything but slots; they just have to present the same style of interface as an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050414223358/http://tunes.org/HLL/general.html#attribute">attribute</a>. So really, a configuration lifted to this level of abstraction can describe functional tests, like assertions.

<p>Non-obvious applications of the concept include <a class="internal" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050414223358/http://cliki.tunes.org/syntax">syntax</a> term trees, which are a kind of information structure that naturally is coupled with higher-order information, but are not a type of collection in the ordinary sense. Another application is the use in describing the relationships between intermediate and end-results in a computation; in this way, multiple-values results can be described in a general way (<em>Note:</em> the abstractness of the attribute concept means that evaluation order, future-ness of values, and such are invisible from the perspective of the configuration).<hr><p><b>This page is linked from: </b> <a class="internal" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050414223358/http://cliki.tunes.org/Hermes">Hermes</a> &nbsp; </div><div id="footer"><form action="https://web.archive.org/web/20050414223358/http://cliki.tunes.org/admin/search"><a class="internal" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050414223358/http://cliki.tunes.org/edit/Configuration">Edit page</a> | <a class="internal" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050414223358/http://cliki.tunes.org/Configuration?source">View source</a> | Revisions: <b title="Tue, 15 Apr 2003 00:31:05 GMT">0</b>  | <input name="words" size="30"><input type="submit" value="search"></form><div id="disclaimer">CTO pages can be modified by anyone at anytime.
