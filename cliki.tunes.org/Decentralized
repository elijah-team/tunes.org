Not even having such an organization in any part of the system.

<p>As for the runtime software executive in an <a class="internal" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050403165217/http://cliki.tunes.org/Operating%20System">Operating System</a>, <em>decentralized</em> means that there is no portion of code that would centralize execution, communication, scheduling, and more generally (meta)service dispatch, as current primitive centralized systems do.

<p>In that latter meaning, Tunes will be decentralized: At runtime, this means no "system call" mechanism, but function calls being directly linked/inlined where needed. As for protection, scoping, typed languages, proof systems, and user wrappers provide much quicker, finer, more expressive protection than a kernel will ever allow. A centralized (kernel-based) architecture is just <em>overhead</em>, and brings <em>no</em> functionality of any kind that couldn't be brought better-faster-cheaper otherwise. The only advantage of it is for throwing off a running implementation quicker, which is good in early design/alpha-test stage, but should certainly not be made a standard interface that would prevent further improvements. See <a class="internal" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050403165217/http://cliki.tunes.org/no-kernel">no-kernel</a> systems.

<p>Runtime software decentralization can be implemented efficiently with a reflective architecture: the system can abstract any part of itself (whether by ability or by a priori assistance) and further replace it. Then a runtime <a class="internal" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050403165217/http://cliki.tunes.org/Code%20Generation">code generator</a> (that itself can be replaced/upgraded) will replace all of interpreter, compiler, linker, <a class="internal" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050403165217/http://cliki.tunes.org/kernel">kernel</a>, etc. Functionality (including <a class="internal" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050403165217/http://cliki.tunes.org/higher-order">higher-order</a>) all goes into libraries, where it belongs.<hr><p><b>This page is linked from: </b> <a class="internal" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050403165217/http://cliki.tunes.org/Publicity">Publicity</a> &nbsp; </div><div id="footer"><form action="https://web.archive.org/web/20050403165217/http://cliki.tunes.org/admin/search"><a class="internal" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050403165217/http://cliki.tunes.org/edit/Decentralized">Edit page</a> | <a class="internal" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050403165217/http://cliki.tunes.org/Decentralized?source">View source</a> | Revisions: <b title="Tue, 18 Mar 2003 02:09:15 GMT">0</b>  | <input name="words" size="30"><input type="submit" value="search"></form><div id="disclaimer">CTO pages can be modified by anyone at anytime.
