<p><hr>
This is a nice interface, but it forces the user to use the mouse too much, which is very inefficient. See <a class="internal" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050412160258/http://cliki.tunes.org/WIMP">WIMP</a> for why windows and mice are bad. -- <a class="internal" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050412160258/http://cliki.tunes.org/seaslug">seaslug</a>

I beg to differ. The mouse is a lot faster than navigating with the keyboard. Switching between the two (which is what is slow, but still faster than navigating with the keyboard) isn't that common in Wily: either you're typing new text with the keyboard, or you're copying or moving text around using the mouse. --AnonymousDonor

Well, you're wrong. period. The mouse is well suited for graphical tasks, but for text, it's slow. On average, a keystroke takes a user .4 seconds to switch his hand from keyboard to mouse and vice versa, and 1.1 seconds to point to a position on the display. These numbers vary on the user and what is being pointed to, but with a text interface like wily, it's likely that the second number is larger because the user is pointing at something so small. In contrast, it takes .2 seconds to tap a key. I understand that it may seem easier to seek to text using a mouse, but try emacs' incremental search to seek to text and you'll be hooked, even though it's modal. Overall, the keyboard is <u>much</u> faster than the mouse. If you don't reply to this argument in a few days I'm going to remove your reply and mine from this page. -- <a class="internal" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050412160258/http://cliki.tunes.org/seaslug">seaslug</a></div><div id="footer"><form action="https://web.archive.org/web/20050412160258/http://cliki.tunes.org/admin/search"><a class="internal" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050412160258/http://cliki.tunes.org/edit/Wily">Edit page</a> | <a class="internal" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050412160258/http://cliki.tunes.org/Wily?source">View source</a> | Revisions: <b title="Sat, 15 Feb 2003 18:00:54 GMT">0</b>  | <input name="words" size="30"><input type="submit" value="search"></form><div id="disclaimer">CTO pages can be modified by anyone at anytime.
