Plan9 *(OS), or what _(Unix) should have been (originally by _(Bell Labs) from where _(Unix) came). It's open source.

It got everything right as for proposing a _(uniform) system interface (the _(dynamic), per-_(process) name->channel "_(file system)" thing) but is still wrong by using a _(low-level) _(programming language) with coarse-_(grain)ed system _(abstraction)s.

See its successor, _(Inferno).
