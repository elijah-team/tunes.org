    <h1>HLL Standard Library Goals</h1>
    <!--#include file="header.html" -->
    <p>Provide a frame where all common algorithms and encodings can and will be written once and for all.</p>
    <p>The benefit of providing such things as a standard is to consolidate maintenance, specification, and communications tasks. The reason that standard provisions will not <em>detract</em> from efficiency of their applications to multiple contexts is that the HLL will provide flexible frameworks for adapting such representations and schemes. This implies that the algorithms and encoding schemes associated with them be specified in a generic manner in a syntax which allows this kind of machine-based manipulation into a context-specific result.</p>
    <p>This requires automatic world-wide unique identification and versioning of objects, and institutions to promote some objects as "standard".</p>

    <h2>Non-goals</h2>
    <p>Note that while the stdlib would be a repository for all kind of code, and the locus for depositing well-known algorithms adapted to the HLL, the development of new code is <em>not</em> part of the stdlib project itself.</p>
    <p>So, this project will leave bootstrap data structures to the <a href="http://tunes.org/LLL">LLL</a> subproject, translation of legacy support and applications to the <A HREF="../meta/index.html">metatranslator</A> subproject, and user-interface-specific issues to the <A HREF="../../Interfaces/index.html">Interfaces</A> subproject.
