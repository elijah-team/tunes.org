<H2><A NAME="Tunes">What is TUNES?</a></H2>
    <p>Actually, this is the one <A HREF="Tunes-FAQ.html">Frequently Asked Question</A> (a.k.a. FAQ) about TUNES.</p>
    <p>Its name is a recursive acronym for: "<B><I>TUNES is a Useful, Nevertheless Expedient, System</I></B>". This refers to a general philosophy of promoting <a href="/cliki.tunes.org/Utility">utility</a> in its general sense over the <a href="/cliki.tunes.org/Expediency">expediency</a> of solving very particular problems at the cost of dividing up the space of solutions.</p>
    <p>Current <A HREF="/cliki.tunes.org/Computing System">Computing Systems</A> are a source of both great enthusiasm before their technical achievements, and great disappointment before the barriers that keep their potential under-exploited. There is a growing gap between the ever-growing hardware potential, and the slowly (though surely) enhancing software realizations.</p>
    <p>TUNES is a <A HREF="/cliki.tunes.org/Cybernetics">cybernetic</A> project, to rethink <A HREF="papers/WhyNewOS/index.html">how Computing Systems should be</A> to fill this gap, which includes social as well as technical considerations: because computer problems are not isolated problems, but part of larger human processes.</p>
<h2><a name="overview">Overview</a></h2>
    <p>The main idea in our analysis of the failure of current <a href="/cliki.tunes.org/Computing System">computing systems</a> is that the goal of a computing system should be to promote fair exchange of mutually-trustable information between independent entities, whereas current systems provide only untrustable raw data under centralized control.</p>
    <p>As a result, TUNES is politically committed to promote libertarian ideas in Computing Systems, and technically committed to build a proof-of-concept system around <EM>semantically clean <A HREF="/cliki.tunes.org/Reflection">reflection</A></EM>.</p>
    <p>The current <a href="/cliki.tunes.org/Computing World">Computing World</a> is based on centralized development, racket on a misdefined "intellectual property", information hiding, lack of expressiveness, insecure low-level communications methods, and general noise. TUNES will promote free decentralized development, a fair market of well-defined services, freely published software, arbitrarily expressive information, secure communications, and meaningfulness.</p>
    <p>A running TUNES system will have many features that are just unimaginable on current systems (see below). Many of them are seperately implemented as isolated pieces of software on various different systems. Only by basing the system on semantics-based reflectivity can these features truly be integrated, and whatever other features users will develop, to be dynamically combined in a decentralized way, freeing the world from existing rackets.</p>
    <p>To sum up the main features in technical terms, TUNES is a project to replace existing <a href="/cliki.tunes.org/Operating Systems">Operating Systems</a>, <a href="/cliki.tunes.org/Programming Languages">Languages</a>, and <a href="/cliki.tunes.org/User Interfaces">User Interfaces</a> by a completely rethought <a href="/cliki.tunes.org/Computing System">Computing System</a>, based on a fully
     <a href="/cliki.tunes.org/Reflective">reflective</A> architecture
	with standard support for
     <a href="/cliki.tunes.org/Unified">unification</A> of system abstractions,
     <a href="/cliki.tunes.org/Security">security</A> based on formal proofs from explicit negociated axioms,
     <a href="/cliki.tunes.org/Higher-order">higher-order</A> functions,
     <a href="/cliki.tunes.org/Self-extensible">self-extensible</A> syntax,
     <a href="/cliki.tunes.org/Grain">fine-grained</A> composition,
     <a href="/cliki.tunes.org/Distributed">distributed</A> networking,
     <a href="/cliki.tunes.org/Orthogonal Persistence">orthogonally persistent</A> storage,
     <a href="/cliki.tunes.org/Fault-tolerant">fault-tolerant</A> computation,
     <a href="/cliki.tunes.org/Version-aware">version-aware</A> identification,
     <a href="/cliki.tunes.org/Decentralized">decentralized (no-kernel)</A> communication,
     <a href="/cliki.tunes.org/Dynamic Compilation">dynamic</A> code regeneration,
     <a href="/cliki.tunes.org/High-level">high-level</A> models of encapsulation,
     <a href="/cliki.tunes.org/Hardware-Independent">hardware-independent</A> exchange of code,
     <a href="/cliki.tunes.org/Migration">migratable</A> actors,
      yet (eventually) a
     <a href="/cliki.tunes.org/Performance">highly-performant</A> set of dynamic compilation tools
      (phew).</p>
    <P>These are <em>not</em> <a href="/cliki.tunes.org/Buzzword">buzzwords</A>, but <em>technical terms</em>, and you should find precise definitions in the <a href="/cliki.tunes.org/Glossary">Glossary</A>.</p>
    <P>We want to implement such a system because we <EM>know</EM> all these are required for the computing industry to compete fairly, which is not currently possible. Even if TUNES itself does not become a world-wide environment, we hope the TUNES experience can speed up the appearance of such an environment that would fulfill our requirements. Likewise, while the TUNES technical goal includes replacing <a href="/cliki.tunes.org/Operating System">Operating Systems</a> (low-level systems software), that this goal <em>per se</em> is not possible in the desired sense until the environment with the desired semantic freedome and features is assembled. Without the environment, a separate set of systems software means nothing.</p>
    <P>The project is divided recursively into <a href="subprojects.html">subprojects</a>, each having its own maintainer, according to the <a href="legalese/Charter.html">TUNES Charter</a>. This page <b>is</b> the root project of the above hierarchy.</p>

<h3>Old blurb:</h3>
<P>
<blockquote>
It is a project to provide both design and implementation of a
<a href="/cliki.tunes.org/Computing System"><EM>computing system</EM></A>,
based upon a paradigm of
<a href="/cliki.tunes.org/Computing Freedom"><EM>computing freedom</EM></A>.
Such a system encompasses all computing software,
from the lowest-level hardware layers of an
<a href="/cliki.tunes.org/Operating System">operating system</A>,
up to the highest-level layers of computer logic,
and including friendly
<a href="Interfaces/index.html">user interfaces</A>,
<a href="HLL/index.html">computer languages</A>,
distributed computing management.
<P>
   Its scope is the whole
<a href="/cliki.tunes.org/Computing World">computing world</A>;
it aims at absolutely <EM>all</EM>
kinds of <a href="/cliki.tunes.org/User">users</A>,
(we make no arbitrary racial or other distinction among them),
from newbies to gurus, humans or machines,
all kinds of computing, from video games to professional expert systems,
on all kind of platforms, from pocket calculators to mainframe computer.</p>
<P>
   Its approach is based on a permanent, serious, deep <EM>reflection</EM>
about how the computing world could be, how it should be,
and why it should be so
(see our article <a href="papers/WhyNewOS/index.html">Why a New OS</A>)
including both theoretical and practical considerations, 
which we invite you to <a href="collaboration.html">share with us</A>.
We believe that both theory without practice and practice without theory
lead to deeply flawed systems.
Thus this project is neither a purely philosophical nor
a purely experimental project: it's an
<a href="/cliki.tunes.org/Ethics">ethical</A> project.</p>
<P>
   Since the project is in an early development stage, we're currently
looking for the guru (or would-be guru) type of collaborator.
Don't be modest; if you're ready to work, you can easily become a guru.
The project is currently not funded, and lives on the spare time of its
collaborators.</p>
<P>
   The project will freely distribute all its code over this
world, but will reserve the right to offer non-free support for it.
Code will be copyrighted so that it will stay freely distributable,
but the project will stay in control of commercial use,
distribution, and support of any code produced.
The essential portions of the OS, those needed to run most everything,
will be GNU copylefted, so everyone can be confident about freely using it.

<UL>
<LI>We are concurrently and cooperatively developing on all fronts. See our <a href="/cliki.tunes.org/Activities">activities page</a> for details.</li>
<LI>Particularly, we are co-developing the languages and applications that will run on top of it, so that each feeds the other ones with useful information.</li>
<LI>The general specifications for the various projects are well-settled, and prototypes are being exercised and built out to refine the specifications and demonstrate solutions.</li>
<LI>In the HLL subprojects, the <a href="HLL/syntax.html">syntax</a> and <a href="HLL/primitives.html">semantics</a> aspects of the system have yet to be finally defined. But many people in the project do not even understand the <a href="HLL/general.html">high-level ideas</a>, so there has to be some explanation first.</li>
<LI>As for the LLL, not much code exists: there was enough to boot a computer, but that's the uninteresting part. The real hard part is a runtime executive for the compiler, including all the low-level drivers. We intend to use metaprogramming to automate the kind of things done by the <a href="/cliki.tunes.org/OSKit">Flux OS toolkit</A>. Ultimately, though, the LLL will be developed from the HLL, so anything done previously exists to be rewritten.</li>
<LI>The main problem currently is to find a few very active members, who would work at least half-time to have TUNES running.</li>
<LI>Perhaps we should look for funding. Should we? But then, inside structure? Tunes is currently a very much like a student's	personal project!</li>
<LI>Of course, we are always actively looking for feedback and new collaborators: <a href="mailto:fare@tunes.org">e-mail us</A>!</li>

<p>All deadlines were blown out. New ones will be established when things are settled: when we have a clear written specification, or at least commonly-understood guidelines.</p>
