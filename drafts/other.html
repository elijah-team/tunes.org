<ul><li><a href='http://piumarta.com/pepsi/'>http://piumarta.com/pepsi/</a>- Ian Piumarta's experimental framework for dynamic languages.

</li></ul></p><p>A possible starting point for TUNES?
</p><hr></hr><p><a href='http://parrotcode.org'>Parrot</a> (2002-present) is a lower-level VM designed mainly for Perl and other dynamic languages (Ruby, Python, Lisp/Scheme, Smalltalk, etc.).
</p><p><ul><li>Not our ideal framework because it's not helpful for metaprogramming, <i>however...</i>
</li><li>It has the potential to consolidate the infrastructure of several popular languages in a more efficient implementation that offers "real" garbage collection, thus providing short-term practical benefits.
</li><li>Should allow mixing code written in different languages... including common-language libraries... which should help to consolidate some of these languages eventually.
</li></ul></p><hr></hr><p><a href='http://llvm.org/'>LLVM</a> - Low Level Virtual Machine
</p><hr></hr><h2>Programming Language projects</h2><hr></hr><p><a href='http://codespeak.net/pypy/dist/pypy/doc/news.html'>PyPy</a> - Python written in Python (2003-present)
</p><p>A few notes:
<ul><li>JIT compilation (as in Psyco - see http://psyco.sourceforge.net/doc.html under "How does it work?")
</li><li>Support for lazy evaluation, logic programming, persistent objects
</li><li>C, LLVM, and .NET CLI back-ends
</li><li>Javascript & Prolog front-ends begun...
</li></ul></p><hr></hr><p>Ruby 2.0 - several implementation efforts underway:
<ul><li><a href='http://jruby.codehaus.org/'>jRuby</a> (Sun Microsystems) - JVM-based, of course. Version 1.0, released June 2007, supports Ruby 1.8.5.
</li><li>Rubinius (Evan Phoenix)
</li><li>MRI (Matz's Reference Implementation)
</li><li>Microsoft Ruby (John Lam)
</li><li>Cardinal (Kevin Tew) - uses the Parrot VM
</li></ul></p><hr></hr><p>Pat Collison's <u>CROMA Lisp</u> - Said to be a cleaner, re-invented Lisp dialect. Won him two awards and no doubt helped him get into MIT.
</p><p>If it's ever released, we'd like to play with it.
</p><hr></hr><p>Squeak Smalltalk explores a lot of ideas related to Tunes.
</p><hr></hr><p>Clean <a href='http://slate.tunes.org'>Slate</a> Smalltalk (2003-2005)
</p><p>Brian Rice says the project is dead, mainly due to poor performance.
</p><hr></hr><p><a href='http://max.tunes.org/'>Max</a> (2002-2004, 2007) - a reflection framework for Common Lisp. It's clear the authors put a lot of thought into this, but it hasn't generate the interest they hoped for. The easiest way to find out what it's all about is to skim the <a href='http://max.tunes.org/doc/max.html'>Documentation</a>.
</p><p>As of August 2007, Tril has resumed work on Max.
</p><hr></hr><p>Retro (1998-2002) showed that driver writing and other "OS stuff" is relatively easy, but FORTH is inadequate for our purposes.
</p><p>After 2002, work continued on <a href='http://retroforth.org/'>RetroForth</a> and its descendants.  Perhaps most notable is <a href='http://factorcode.org'>Factor</a>, which has more in common with Lisp than with Forth.
