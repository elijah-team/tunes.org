    <h1>Goals for the O'TOP Subproject</h1>
    <!--#include file="header.html" -->
    <p>Implement the Tunes project <em>On Top Of POSIX</em>, so that Tunes runs on any new hardware, as POSIX is the one standard, which is ported on any new architecture (actually, most new architectures are conceived with POSIX in mind).</p>
    <p>Thus, as new hardware platforms grow in power, even if O'TOP offers only a constant 10% of efficiency as compared to "optimized C", it will allow TUNES to follow hardware enhancements, and may be a platform to develop architecture-specific implementations. Moreover, architecture-specific enhancements to the POSIX implementation, even if slower and less reliable than a full port, may provide more speed and much more functionality than standard POSIX optimized C.
    <p>The implementation should be faithful to the <a href="../index.html">LLL specifications</a>, and device drivers should be provided to allow basic memory management, human interaction, and access to mass storage.</p>
