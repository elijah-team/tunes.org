    <h3>About Tunes vs the WWW and CGI scripts</h3>

<p>CGI scripts do allow dynamic generation of documents,
but are a crippled low-level way to do that,
and do NOT allow browsing of meta-document.
Any tactics that the user would want to use as browsing a meta-document
must be foreseen by the CGI script writer so the reader can use them;
and if by chance, the script is made expressive enough
to allow the same power as full meta-browsing,
this would be in a new ad-hoc undocumented unreliable programming language
with a slow remote interface that the reader doesn't have the time to learn,
so can only use trivial tactics.
<p>
The Web is but yet another kind of coarse-grained client/server crap,
where the reader is on a terminal
(that displays a layout text document from HTML input,
instead of a raw character array from VT100 codes)
and is denied any computation power,
while only the server-writer can put anything to the document.
To achieve meta-browsing through the WWW,
we oughto rewrite a full reflective OS on the server side,
that must cope with a stupid horrible unexpressive
HTML language as its only interface. Yuck.
<p>
Also, using URLs is like having to work with pointers, not objects,
in an environment with an unreliable buggy moving GC.
It just can't work, so that a reliable meta-browsing server on the WWW
cannot include meta-browsable external references.
<p>
To sum it up, the WWW is NOT a meta-browsing system,
just a "hyper-browsing" system.
"Hyper-browsing" only allows browsing in multilinear ways,
which is not better (though often faster) than a book with a good index.
The rare cases of interaction in the WWW are very limited,
and the reader is completely subject to the publisher as for this interaction.
<p>
On the opposite side,
Tunes is a "Meta-browsing" system,
that allows arbitrary extraction of information
from the document view as a semantically meaningful object
instead of a meaningless syntactical stream of bits.
