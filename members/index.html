<H1>TUNES Project Members</H1>

<p>

TUNES lurkers are those who think TUNES ideas are cool, or interesting, and
often check back at this site for updates.  If you are one of these people,
sign up below and you can get your information published on our site for
others to read.

<p>

TUNES members are those who go above and beyond visiting the site now and
then, and actually contribute something on the project. This might be as
little as posting on the mailing list or editing web pages, or as
involved as writing code for a prototype system that helps explore TUNES
ideas.

<p>

If you actually need access to TUNES CVS or are a contributor and want a
@tunes.org email address or other hosting, then visit the <a
href="http://bespin.org/application.html">Bespin Account Application</a> page,
and enter TUNES as the project. If you're listed under <a
href="/tunes.org/cgi-bin/members#Contributors">Contributors</a>, you will
probably be granted an account.

<p>

(There's also a <a href="/tunes.org/cgi-bin/members">short list</a>
if you prefer that.)
